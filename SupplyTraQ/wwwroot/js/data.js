Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: Subject is > or = 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF). Documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma Must have received at least 3 prior MM treatment regimens. Note: induction with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplant and with or without maintenance therapy is considered a single regimen. Must have undergone at least 2 consecutive cycles of treatment for each regimen, unless PD was the best response to the regimen. Must have received a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody. Must be refractory to the last treatment regimen. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1. Subjects must have measurable disease, including at least one of the criteria below: Serum M-protein greater or equal to 1.0 g/dL Urine M-protein greater or equal to 200 mg/24 h Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level greater or equal to 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal - Bone marrow plasma cells > 30% of total bone marrow cells Recovery to Grade 1 or baseline of any non-hematologic toxicities due to prior treatments, excluding alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements within this protocol as well as agrees to continued follow-up for up to 15 years as mandated by the regulatory guidelines for gene therapy trials. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP (see note 1 below)) must: - Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the Investigator, one negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ß-hCG] pregnancy test result at screening, prior to LD chemotherapy. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact. - Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective measures of contraception without interruption, from screening through 1 year following last bb2121 infusion. Contraception methods must include 1 highly effective and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception from screening until at least 12 months following bb2121 infusion and until CAR T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests, whichever occurs last. - Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 1-year post-bb2121 infusion and until CAR T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests, whichever occurs last.  Note 1: A female of childbearing potential is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  Male subjects must: - Practice true abstinence* or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. Subjects will be followed from screening until at least 1 year following last bb2121 infusion and until CAR T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests, whichever occurs last.  * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.",
