Eleven patients demonstrated a positive ELISPOT response (>10 spots and > or = 2 × baseline) at week 12 and 12 patients did not (P=0.002). Median survival from time of treatment between ELISPOT-positive and -negative groups was significantly different (550 vs 159 days, P=0.036), as was median survival from the time of procurement (627 vs 257 days, respectively, P=0.043).  Conclusion: The IFN- ELISPOT assay may provide an effective measure of immune response following treatment with 'triad vaccines', but additional patient numbers and/or other immune modulatory parameters are necessary for future testing. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23466552 http://www.nature.com/gt/journal/v20/n9/full/gt20139a.html http://dendritic.info/dc-trials/current-us-trials/  January 01, 2011  Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Jan 1;17(1):183-92. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2195 Received August 16, 2010; Accepted October 10, 2010; Published online January 5, 2011 Olivares J, Kumar P, Yu Y, Maples PB, Senzer N, Bedell C, Barve M, Tong A, Pappen BO, Kuhn J, Magee M, Wallraven G, Nemunaitis J. Phase I trial of TGF-beta 2 antisense GM-CSF gene-modified autologous tumor cell (TAG) vaccine. Interim Results: Vaccine manufacturing efficiency was 84% (32/38). Twenty-three patients received at least 1 vaccination. There were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities, and grade 1 and 2 events were local in nature. Seventeen of 21 patients had stable disease (SD) at month 2 or later as their best response, and 1 patient with stage IVa malignant melanoma achieved a complete response (CR) following 11 vaccinations and remains without evidence of disease 2 years following initiation of therapy. Six of 13 patients displayed a positive enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) response to autologous TAG vaccine at week 12 including 3 patients with prolonged SD or CR. The 3 other patients survived through week 24, as compared with none of the 7 ELISPOT-negative patients. Conclusions:  On the basis of safety and clinical and immunologic results, further evaluation of bifunctional vaccines is warranted.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21208907 http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1/183.long http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1/183.full.pdf+html May 19, 2010  Presented at 13th Annual Meeting of American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, May 19-22, 2010, Washington, DC, USA Abstract No: 275  Phillip B. Maples, Padmasini Kumar, Yang Yu, Beena O. Pappen, Joseph Kuhn, John Nemunaitis  TAG Vaccine Clinical Trial Manufacturing  Interim Results:  Average GM-CSF expression is 823+1376pg/1x106 cells/ml, median 230pg and range 7-5071pg. The mean pretransfection TGFß1 is 3225+2941pg/1x106 cells/ml, median 2950pg. The mean posttransfection TGFß1 is 2964+2644pg/1x106 cells/ml, median 2550pg. The average percent knockdown of TGFß1 was -32+160%, median 6% and range -833-(+97)%. The mean pretransfection TGFß2 is 784+1118pg/1x106 cells/ml, median 385pg. The mean posttransfection TGFß2 is 203+198pg/1x106 cells/ml, median 150pg. The average percent knockdown of TGFß2 was 52+39 %, median 45% and range -8-(+100)%. In all but two instances, GM-CSF secretion met our product release specification. TGFß2 knockdown was evident in all vaccines although in 4 instances it did not reach our 30% knockdown goal. TGFß1 expression was assessed pre and post transfection (no effect) and TGFß1 levels were typically much higher than TGFß2 levels.  Conclusion: TGFß1 is thought to be the more dominant immunosuppressive agent in many cancers and these data underscore its presence in these tumors and vaccine products.

Tong, Phillip B. Maples.  A Phase I Trial of GMCSF Gene-TGF2 Antisense Gene Autologous Tumor Cell (TAG) Vaccine in Advanced Cancer Interim Results:  Twenty-eight patients have undergone tumor harvest for vaccine therapy, 15 have received between 1 and 9 vaccinations. Harvested malignant tissue is processed to a single cell suspension, and cells are transfected via electroporation with our novel TAG expression vector. Patients receive monthly intradermal injections in two dosing cohorts (1x107 cells/injection or 2.5x107 cells/injection) for a minimum of 4 months. Ten patients are currently on trial with no evidence of PD (1-10 months). Four patients have been removed for PD (2-5 months) and one discontinued treatment with stable disease for personal reasons (1 month).  Conclusions: Preliminary results reveal prolonged stable disease ( > or = 3 months) in 7 of 8 patients with sufficient follow up. No adverse events have been demonstrated. TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2 and GMCSF expression are being monitored for correlation with disease response. An update of clinical results will be presented.

Maples  HLA Typing as an Identity Test for Patients and Their FANGTM Autologous Cancer Vaccines ...To date we have analyzed 25 vaccine–blood pairs from patients on the following autologous vaccine trials (FANGTM Phase I, 4 pts; FANGTM Phase II Ovarian, 17 pts; FANGTM Phase II Melanoma, 2 pts; and TAG Phase I, 2 pts). All patient vaccine-blood pairs matched with one exception. The one exception is a Phase I FANGTM patient in whom the tumor has lost one haplotype compared to the peripheral blood MNC (had discordance between MNC and tumor at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ). DNA sequencing studies are underway to fully characterize the extent of the changes in the tumor HLA alleles as compared with peripheral blood MNC. Using HLA molecular genotyping as an identity test is quite feasible but it is also expected that a certain, albeit limited, frequency of tumors will have alterations in their HLA alleles necessitating further workup i.e. sequencing to determine the nature of their changes as well as confirmation of the matching in identity. http://www.abstracts2view.com/asgct/view.php?nu=ASGT12L1_199 May 15, 2012 (Analysis) Presented at: American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy 2012 Abstract No: 464 John Nemunaitis, Neil Senzer, Jairo Olivares, Padmasini Kumar, Minal Barve, Joseph Kuhn, Thomas Nemunaitis, Mitchell Magee, Yang Yu, Gladice Wallraven, Beena O. Pappen, Phillip B. Maples Correlation of Immune Response with Long Term Survival of Refractory Cancer Patients Who Received TGF-ß2 Antisense/GM-CSF Gene Modified Autologous Tumor Cell (TAG) Vaccine Results:  We now present long term follow up of a subset of 23 of these patients who received a minimum of 3 TAG vaccinations and had baseline and week 12 ELISPOT analysis done. Eleven of these 23 patients had a positive ELISPOT response and 12 had no response at week 12 (p=0.002) as indication of activation of induced tumor specific T cell activity at week 12. All week 12 responders continued to show similar level of response at week 24. One patient demonstrating prolonged continued response (metastatic melanoma) achieved a CR solely attributable to TAG and continued to show persistent ELISPOT response for 92+ weeks after discontinuation of the vaccine. Positive ELISPOT responding patients also had suggestive improved survival at a mean of 894 days (median 627 days) in comparison to patients with negative response who had a mean of 444 days (median 257 days) from time of tumor harvest, however results did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.077).  Conclusion:  In conclusion, results support utilization of ELISPOT assay for continued assessment of immune response of vaccines utilizing a “triad” approach. Results of TAG will be compared to recent results published from Phase I study of FANG (Senzer et al Mol Ther 2011).

Maples, Padmasini Kumar, Yang Yu, Ila Oxendine, Joseph Kuhn, John Nemunaitis  Autologous Tumor Cell Vaccine Genetically Modified To Express GM-CSF and Block Expression of TGF2.  Results: Twenty-eight patients have been consented for vaccine manufacturing. Tumor types collected include colorectal (7), NSCLC (5), breast (4) and melanoma (3). Of the 24 successful manufacturing processes, 8 patients' vaccines are in the low dose cohort (1e7 cells per dose) and 16 patients' vaccines are in the high dose cohort (2.5e7 cells per dose). There were 4 manufacturing failures, due to insufficient starting material (2) or contamination (2). The contaminations occurred with tumor tissue procured from colorectal cancer patients. We no longer harvest tumor for vaccine manufacturing from the visceral lumeral area. Product stability has been monitored over one year by sterility, GM-CSF mRNA and TGF2 antisense expression and other parameters. After each patient vaccine is manufactured, GM-CSF and TGFbeta2 protein expression are assessed by immunoassay comparing transfected and nontransfected tumor cell expression over 14 days.  Conclusions: In all but two instances, GM-CSF secretion met our product release specification. TGFbeta2 knockdown was evident in all instances although in 4 instances it did not reach the 30% knockdown goal. TGFbeta1 expression was also assessed pre and post transfection (no effect) and TGFbeta1 levels were typically ten-fold higher than TGFbeta2 levels. TGFbeta1 is thought to be the more dominant immunosuppressive agent in many cancers and these data underscore its presence in these tumors and vaccine products.

In Stage 1, successive groups of 3 to 6 patients will receive progressively higher PTC299 dose levels; in this stage, treatment will be given in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of 4 weeks of oral PTC299 twice per day followed by a 2-week, no-drug period. In Stage 2, additional groups of 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3  times per day continuously (ie, without the 2-week no-drug period as in Stage 1). In Stage 3, additional groups of 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated 3-week cycles consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times continuously in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks). All planned dose levels in all stages are expected to achieve circulating blood levels of PTC299 known to be active in animal models of human cancer.

Winkelman, Yen Thi Kim Hong Cao, LaShaina Shakes, Kerri Donnelly, Charles Harris Darby, Thomas W. Davis, Gary L. Elfring, Gary K. Schwartz Circulating VEGF levels as a biomarker to clinical benefit to PTC299, the first inhibitor of VEGF synthesis. Interim Results:  The study enrolled 46 patients (20 males; 26 females; median age: 62 years). Patients with lower VEGF reductions while on therapy (<10%, n=12) had a median duration of stable disease of 5.3 weeks while patients with greater maximal VEGF reductions (> or =10%, n=31) had significantly longer stable disease (median 12.0 weeks, log-rank p<0.001). VEGF decreases were greater in patients with higher baseline values. No Grade 3 or 4 hypertension, bleeding, or proteinuria occurred. One patient had an acute liver injury.  Conclusions:  Reductions in circulating VEGF are associated with prolonged duration of anti-angiogenic therapy and stable disease. Results are consistent with preclinical experiments and support the hypothesis that PTC299 does not affect physiologic VEGF but inhibits pathologic VEGF. In this study, oral administration of PTC299 as monotherapy or in combination with docetaxel therapy has been generally well tolerated at all doses tested. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/98458-114  http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/15_suppl/e13588  May 18, 2011 J Clin Oncol 29: 2011 (suppl; abstr 3069) 2011 ASCO Annual Meeting Abstract No: 3069 J. J. Luke, L. A. Callahan, C. H. Darby, E. Moss, J. Winkelman, J. Barth, G. L. Elfring, A. Ogden, G. K. Schwartz, M. M. Gounder Results of a study of the oral inhibitor PTC299 on tumor VEGF synthesis. Interim Results:  Stages 1 and 2 enrolled 29 patients; (M13:F16); median age 61 years (range 30-80); ECOG PS 0 (n=17) or 1 (n=12); median prior therapies for metastatic disease 2.5 (range 0 to 8). No MTD was observed through 200 mg TID. Adverse events were infrequent, usually Grade 1. There was no hypertension. Median time on treatment was 10 weeks (range 0.3 to 84) including 3 H&N patients (12, 12, 63+ wks), 4 thyroid carcinoma patients (6, 10, 12, 84 wks) and 3 chondrosarcoma patients (30, 31+, 36 wks). 21 had pre/post sVEGF samples. D1 sVEGF levels were elevated (normal < or = 300 pg/mL) in 10/21 patients. Patients with elevated D1 sVEGF have statistically significant D42 sVEGF decrease as compared to those with normal D1 sVEGF, with median reduction of 165.3 pg/mL (37.7%) and 20.8 pg/mL (18.3%) respectively (p=0.001). PTC299-induced sVEGF reductions were correlated with stable disease > or = 12 wks (p=0.049) and were dose-dependent.  Conclusions:  Single-agent PTC299 significantly reduces circulating sVEGF in patients with elevated D1 levels. The drug has been generally well tolerated and shows clinical benefit, especially in patients where sVEGF reductions were observed. These data give preliminary support for the proposed mechanism of action that PTC299 inhibits tumor VEGF with unchanged physiological sVEGF production. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/81888-102  http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/15_suppl/3069 May 20, 2010  J Clin Oncol 28:15s, 2010 (suppl; abstr 3041)  2010 ASCO Annual Meeting  Abstract No: 3041  G.

Interim Results:  The study enrolled 27 patients (9 males, 18 females) with median [range] age 59 [31-75] years, ECOG PS 0 (n=16) or 1 (n=11), 13 tumor types, and median [range] of prior therapies of 3 [0-8] to receive PTC299 in stage 1 (n=12), stage 2 (n=6), or stage 3 (n=9). Median [range] of time on treatment has been 10 [3-61+] weeks. No MTD was observed through the highest dose levels: stage 1, 1.2 mg/kg BID; stage 2, 120 mg TID; and stage 3, 100 mg TID. Adverse events were infrequent, usually grade 1, and not generally considered PTC299-related. No hypertension was observed. PTC299 PK were generally dose proportional, with rapid appearance of drug in plasma, Tmax  of ~4 hours, and an effective t1/2 of ~12 hours. From day 1 to day 28 (stage 1) or day 42 (stage 2), PTC299 showed a ~2-fold accumulation when dosed continuously. Trough plasma concentrations exceeded values associated with maximal preclinical antitumor activity. Decreases in circulating angiogenic VEGF and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) were seen. Patients with thyroid cancer (n=2), chondrosarcoma (n=1), and head and neck cancers (n=3) remain on study with stable disease for 14+, 2.8+, 8+, 5.6+, 3.7+, and 2.6+ months respectively. Patients with other advanced cancers (n=5) completed the study with stable disease for 3.5-12 months.  Conclusions:  PTC299 monotherapy or combination therapy with docetaxel is generally well tolerated, achieves target plasma concentrations, and shows evidence of pharmacodynamic and clinical activity.  http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/53268-74  http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/15_suppl/3041?sid=06b3c117-8cab-455b-8111-a0d3372054e5 November 15, 2009  Mol Cancer Ther 2009;8(12 Suppl):B2.  21st EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics  Abstract No: B2  Gary Schwartz, Harry Miao, Mark Dickson, Leslie Rodrigues, Mary Llorente, Yen Cao, Heather Dials, Charles H. Darby, Gary Elfring, Langdon L.Miller  Results of a phase 1b study of PTC299, a novel oral inhibitor of tumor VEGF expression, in patients with advanced cancer.  Interim Results:  The study has enrolled 18 subjects (6 males, 12 females) with median [range] age 61 [31-81] years, ECOG performance status of 0 (n=10) or 1 (n=8), 9 different tumor types, and median [range] of prior therapies of 3 [0-8] to receive PTC299 in Stage 1 (n=12) and Stage 2 (n=6). Median [range] of time on treatment has been 2 [1-7] cycles. No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established through the highest dose levels tested: Stage 1, 1.2 mg/kg/dose BID and Stage 2, 100 mg/dose TID. Adverse events have been infrequent, usually Grade 1, and have not generally been considered PTC299-related. No hypertension has been observed. PTC299 pharmacokinetics is generally dose proportional, with rapid appearance of drug in plasma, Tmax of ~4 hours, and an effective t1/2 of ~12 hours. From Day 1 to Day 28 in Stage 1 (Day 42 in Stage 2), there has been an increase in plasma concentrations at all dose levels, indicating accumulation (~2 fold) when PTC299 is dosed continuously. PTC299 trough plasma concentrations have exceeded values of 0.5-1.0 g/mL associated with maximal activity in mouse xenograft models. PTC299 treatment has been associated with reductions in circulating angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. Five of eighteen (28%) patients with thyroid cancer, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and chondrosarcoma (2) have remained on study with stable disease for 11+, 4.5, 5, 6+, and 4.5+ months respectively.A patient with papillary thyroid cancer has had a sustained tumor marker decrease of >50% lasting for >7 months.  Discussion: Single-agent PTC299 has been well tolerated, has achieved target plasma concentrations, and has shown evidence of pharmacodynamic and clinical activity.

Davis Utility of VEGF and IL-6 as biomarkers for response to PTC299, a novel antiangiogenic Results:  The two studies enrolled 72 patients (15 males, 57 females) with median [range] age 60 [26-82] years, and ECOG PS 0 (n = 39) or 1 (n = 33). Paired VEGF and IL-6 baseline and EOC1 specimens were available from 58 and 48 patients. Patients with normal VEGF at Day 1 (n = 37) had a small mean (SD) increase in VEGF at EOC1 of 18 (122) pg/mL. Patients with elevated VEGF at Day 1 (n = 21) had a significant mean (SD) reduction in VEGF at EOC1 of -150 (188) pg/mL (p = 0.001). Patients with moderately elevated IL-6 at Day 1 (n = 25) had a mean (SD) increase in IL-6 at EOC1 of 6 (11) pg/mL. Patients with highly elevated IL-6 at Day 1 (n = 23) had a significant mean (SD) reduction in IL-6 at EOC1 of -13 (16) pg/mL (p < 0.001). No incidence of grade 3 or 4 hypertension, bleeding, or proteinuria occurred. Conclusion:  PTC299 offers a novel mechanistic approach to antiangiogenesis by selectively inhibiting pathological VEGF and IL-6 expression. This hypothesis is supported by the reduction of VEGF and IL-6 in patients with elevated levels at baseline and the adverse event profile observed to date.

The study is designed in 3 stages. In Stage 1, up to 18 patients will receive increasingly higher doses of PTC299 in a repeated on-off pattern (4 weeks on drug and 2 weeks off drug) to assess the drug’s safety. In Stage 2, a second group of up to 12 patients will receive PTC299 every day. In Stage 3, a third group of up to 12 patients will receive PTC299 together with the chemotherapy medication, docetaxel (Taxotere)   Important Requirements for Taking Part in This Study     * be willing and able to participate in study procedures     * be willing to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ an effective barrier or medical method of contraception during the study     * be willing to undergo two tumor biopsies Other eligibility requirements will be explained at the trial site.

(PTC) today announced the initiation of two clinical trials of the company's product candidate PTC299 in adult patients with solid tumor cancers and Kaposi Sarcoma, a HIV-related cancer... ...An open-label Phase 1b clinical trial will enroll up to 42 patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of PTC299 alone and in combination with Taxotere (docetaxel) chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of PTC299. The trial will also assess the overall safety profile of the drug when administered alone and in combination with chemotherapy, evaluate its effect on the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its antitumor activity, and its pharmacokinetics. The study will be conducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. \"As principal investigator of the Phase 1b clinical trial in advanced cancer, I am encouraged by promising preclinical and early clinical PTC299 data that suggest a distinctive approach to inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and an overall well tolerated safety profile,\" said Gary K. Schwartz, M.D., Chief, Melanoma and Sarcoma Service of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. \"PTC299 has the potential to address significant unmet medical need for patients with multiple tumor types.\" (URL expired)  http://ptct.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=354897",

Preliminary results for the phase 1 trial of a dual HER2 peptide cancer vaccine in breast and ovarian cancer patients Interim Results: 28 patients enrolled; 8 withdrew consent, 1 recurred prior to completing R6, 3 had an intercurrent illness, 14 patients completed R1-R6, and the vaccine series is ongoing in 2 patients. Six patients did not receive any inoculations and, therefore, are not included in this safety analysis. In 22 patients, the vaccine was well tolerated (max local tox: 23% Grade (Gr) 1, 73% Gr 2, 4% Gr 3; max systemic tox: 14% Gr 0, 50% Gr 1, 36% Gr 2). No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. For the 14 patients who completed the VS, the median age was 51(35-83). Breast tumor size was 3.3+ or -1.1cm and ovarian tumor size was 10.0+ or -2.3cm. Compared to GP2 LR at R1 (15.5+ or -4.1mm), LR increased at R2 (31.7+ or -5.9mm), R3 (42.9+ or -7.4mm), R4 (35.3+ or -7.3mm), R5 (45.0+ or -9.9mm), and R6 (25.9+ or -6.7mm, p=0.17). Compared to the AE37 LR at R1 (18.5+ or -3.8mm), LR increased at R2 (37.3+ or -6.7mm), R3 (36.4+ or -4.6mm), R4 (42.2+ or -5.9mm), R5 (46.0+ or -8.9mm), and R6 (36.2+ or -6.6mm). Unless stated, all LR p-values < 0.05. After the VS, AE37 DTH increased from 0.0+ or -0.0mm to 19.6+ or -6.7mm (p<0.01), AE36 DTH increased from 0.0+ or -0.0mm to 10.3+ or -3.9mm (p<0.01), and GP2 DTH reactions increased from 0.3+ or -0.2mm to 4.1+ or -2.0mm (p=0.056). Conclusions:  Initial results from a phase I trial of a vaccine combining GP2 and AE37 peptides show that dual administration of the peptides is well tolerated at all tested dosing levels. Additionally, the combination is capable of stimulating strong peptide-specific in vivo immune responses. Continued testing of this vaccination strategy is underway. http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs13/view.php?nu=SABCS13L_1550  http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/73/24_Supplement/P4-13-02",

Central confirmation of HER2 status is not required. Participants must have measurable CNS disease, defined as at least one parenchymal brain lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 10 mm by local radiology review (note: measurable non-CNS disease is NOT required for study participation). See section 10 for the evaluation of measureable disease. New or progressive CNS lesions, as assessed by the patient's treating physician. It is anticipated that some participants may have multiple progressive CNS lesions, one or several of which are treated with SRS or surgery with residual un-treated lesions remaining. Such participants are eligible for enrollment on this study providing that at least one untreated lesion is measurable, as defined in section 3.1.2. The location of the measurable lesion should be documented in the patient chart and case report form. Participants who have had prior cranial surgery are eligible, provided that there is evidence of measurable residual or progressive lesions. If a patient has surgical resection followed by WBRT, then there must be evidence of progressive CNS disease after the completion of WBRT. Participants who have had prior WBRT and/or SRS and then whose lesions have progressed thereafter are also eligible. In this case, lesions which have been treated with SRS may be considered as target lesions if there is unequivocal evidence, in the opinion of the treating physician, of progression following SRS. Participants who have not previously been treated with cranial radiation (e.g. WBRT or SRS) are eligible to enter the study, but such participants must be asymptomatic from their CNS metastases and not requiring corticosteroids.

      "TreatmentPlan": "Trastuzumab will be given at the standard full dose with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg on Day 1, cycle 1, followed by 6 mg/kg in subsequent cycles. Participants who are within 5 weeks of a 6 mg/kg dose or within 2 weeks of a 2 mg/kg dose of trastuzumab at the time of initial study dosing will not be required to have a re-loading dose but will begin treatment at 6 mg/kg.ARRY-380 will be escalated until MTD is defined or the maximum planned dose has been evaluated. The dose for subsequent dose levels will be determined according to the treatment-related AE observed during the cycle 1 (21 days) in the previous dose level If a patient participates in this research study, the patient will receive ARRY-380 and a drug-dosing diary to record when the patient took ARRY-380 for each study treatment cycle. Each study treatment cycle will last for 3 weeks (21 days) during which time the patient will be taking ARRY-380 by mouth every day. At the time the patient enters the study, the patient will be assigned to either Arm A or Arm B. The difference between the two study arms includes ARRY-380 administered twice-daily (450mg morning and evenings - Arm A) or once-daily (750mg morning - Arm B). The patient will also be given Trastuzumab by intravenous infusion (by vein) on day 1 of each cycle (same dose and schedule for both study arms). The dose of trastuzumab will be the same for everyone on study, and will be the standard approved dose for this medication. In the first portion of the study, the investigators will examine the effects of different dose of ARRY-380 when given in combination with trastuzumab. Initially, 3 participants will be treated with a low dose of the ARRY-380 in combination with standard dose of trastuzumab. If this dose does not cause intolerable side effects, more participants may receive the drug combination at the same dose. The patient will be informed of the assigned dose when the patient enters the study. The patient will be asked to take ARRY-380 for as long as the study treatment is of possible benefit to the patient. After the patient is finished taking ARRY-380, the study doctor will ask the patient to visit the office for follow-up exams for at least one more visit within 4 weeks of the patient's last study treatment. At the start of each cycle the patient will have: A medical history, which includes questions about health, current medications, and any allergies. Performance status, which evaluates the ability to carry on with usual activities. Physical examination, the doctor will examine the patient body, including measuring height, weight, and vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature, pulse rate and breathing rate). A neurological examination to asses any neurological symptoms (for example, difficulties with balance) Blood tests will be drawn at the beginning of each study treatment cycle for tests to monitor the function of liver and kidneys and to check blood cell counts. In addition, blood tests will be drawn on days 4, 8, and 15 of the first cycle of study treatment to monitor liver function. Periodically the patient will undergo:  The patient will have a brain MRI every two cycles. If the brain scans are stable or improved after the patient has been on the study for 6 months or longer, the frequency of your body scans will be decreased to once every 4 cycles. The patient will also have CT or MRI scans of the body at the end of cycle 2, cycle 4 and every 4 cycles thereafter. The research doctor may ask the patient to have a bone scan at the same time points if this is clinically indicated. Electrocardiogram (EKG), which shows the electrical activity of the heart. It will be performed on Day 1 of cycle 2. Echocardiogram (ECHO) (ultrasound of the heart) or MUGA scan (test of heart function using a small amount of a radioactive substance). This will be performed every 3-4 months. Additional research procedures to be performed: On Cycle 1, Day 15 blood for (\"PK\") pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the drug) sampling will be drawn before the morning dose of ARRY-380, after 2 hours and after six hours. Blood tests for research, which will include about 2 tablespoons of blood collected before cycle 1 and after coming off study treatment. In general terms, scientists will study the genes, the RNA, and the proteins that are found in the blood samples. Scientists will also measure and characterize circulating tumor cells in the blood, if they are present. In addition, these specimens may be tested with new types of tests, as they become available. Results of the research tests on blood will not be reported back to the patient. Archival Tumor Tissue Sample: A sample (or samples) of the patient's tumor tissue (from a past surgery and/or biopsy) will be collected and used to learn more about the development of metastatic breast cancer. In general terms, scientists will study the genes, the RNA, and the proteins that are found both in breast tumors and in normal tissue. In addition, these specimens may be tested with new types of tests, as they become available. Laboratory-based investigators conducting this research will not have access to patient identification information such as name or medical record number. Results of the research tests on tissue will not be reported back to the patient. After the final dose of the study drug: The patient will have a follow-up visit one month after coming off study treatment. During that visit, the patient will have a physical examination, functional assessment, assessment of any toxicities and current medications. If the patient continues to have ongoing side effects related to the study treatment, the investigators will continue to follow the patient until these side effects resolve. If the patient withdrew from the study for another reason other than tumor progression, the patient will continue to be followed until tumor progression. Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to keep track of the patient's medical condition indefinitely. The investigators would like to do this either by seeing the patient in clinic or by contacting the patient and the patient's primary doctor periodically to see how the patient is doing. Keeping in touch with the patient and checking the patient's condition periodically helps the investigators look at the long-term effects of the research study.",

Interim Results: Between Aug 2013 and March 2016, 41 patients were enrolled. Median age was 49 (range 29-65); ECOG performance status 0-1 (85%), 2 (15%). 34 (83%) patients had progressed after prior WBRT and/or SRS. Patients had a median of 2 prior treatments for metastatic breast cancer prior to enrollment. As of June 7, 2016, median number of cycles was 4 (range 1-32); 4 patients remain on active protocol therapy. 2 DLTs were observed among 5 patients treated at 450 mg BID (G3 thrombocytopenia and G3 thrombocytopenia and G3 ALT). The dose was de-escalated to 300 mg BID, and with 0/3 patients experiencing a DLT. 300mg BID was identified as the MTD and an additional 14 patients were enrolled at this dose level. 1/7 patients experienced a DLT at 750 mg QD (G3 ALT). At 900 mg QD, 2/2 patients experienced a DLT (2 patients had G3 ALT/AST). An additional 10 patients were enrolled at the MTD of 750 mg QD. The most common AEs, regardless of relationship, were fatigue, diarrhea, AST/ALT elevation, nausea, headache. Gr 3/4 AST/ALT elevation has occurred in 9/41 patients (22%), though has been reversible with dose interruption and reduction. One Gr 3 diarrhea has occurred at 450 mg BID, and 1 Gr 3 diarrhea has occurred at 750 mg QD. PK assessments showed similar exposure of ONT-380 for QD and BID regimens. Preliminary assessment CNS response is available for 19 patients in the QD cohort (5% PR, 89% SD, 5% PD) and 17 patients in the BID cohort (12% PR, 59% SD, 12% PD, 18% unknown). Preliminary non-CNS assessment for the same population is as follows: QD cohort (100% SD); BID cohort (6% PR, 71% SD and 23% unknown). Conclusions: The combination of ONT-380 and trastuzumab is feasible. The combination has an acceptable safety profile with low incidence and severity of diarrhea and rash. Transaminase elevation was asymptomatic for all patients and resolved with drug interruption/delay. Preliminary evidence of activity was observed in CNS and non-CNS disease. http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs/view.php?nu=SABCS16L_1460",

Krop, W. Jerry Younger, Elizabeth S Lawler, Eric P. Winer, Nancy U. Lin; \t\t Phase I dose-escalation trial of ONT-380 in combination with trastuzumab in participants with brain metastases from HER2+ breast cancer. Methods:  This is an open-label, dose finding phase I study. The primary objectives are to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and schedule of ONT-380 in combination with trastuzumab in patients with HER2+ BC and CNS metastases. Secondary objectives include CNS objective response rate by RECIST and volumetric criteria, progression-free survival and OS. Correlative science analysis includes collection of circulating tumor cells at baseline and time of progression for molecular characterization, including FISH studies for EGFR, HER2, Met, and Myc. The study has two parallel arms with two dose regimens of ONT-380, either twice-daily or once-daily, in combination with standard dose trastuzumab. The dose level of ARRY-380 in the initial and subsequent dose escalation cohorts will be 450 and 600mg for the BID regimen and 750, 900, 1200mg for the QD regimen. Eligibility criteria include measurable disease in the CNS, ECOG performance status 0 to 2, and no limit on prior therapies. We utilize a 3+3 dose escalation design with an expansion phase of 16 participants per arm, which will provide additional information on the safety and biologic activity of the treatment combination. In addition, 16 participants per arm at the MTD will give an 89% probability of selecting the best regimen under a “pick the winner” selection design if true probabilities of clinical benefit are 10% and 30% respectively. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/131669-144 February 20, 2014 Excerpted From: Oncothyreon and Array BioPharma Announce Initiation of Phase 1b Trial of ONT-380 in Combination with TDM-1 in Patients with Metastatic HER2+ Breast Cancer ...About ONT-380 ...The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, is also currently conducting an investigator-sponsored trial of ONT-380 in combination with Herceptin in patients with brain metastases from HER2+ breast cancer... http://ir.oncothyreon.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=827049 September 3, 2013 Oncothyreon Announces Initiation of Phase 1 Trial of ONT-380 in Combination with Trastuzumab in Patients with Brain Metastases from HER2+ Breast Cancer ...Oncothyreon...today announced the initiation of an investigator-sponsored trial of ONT-380 in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with brain metastases from HER2+ breast cancer.

Lewandowski, V.L. Gates, E. Gonda, R. Salem Dose-escalating study of Yttrium-90 microspheres with capecitabine for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic disease to the liver: Preliminary results Interim Results: From April 2009 to August 2010, eight patients have been treated according to the study protocol, including two patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, four patients with metastatic colon and two patients with metastatic breast cancer to the liver. The maximum tolerated dose of Y90 has not yet been exceeded. Five patients have been treated with 110Gy and three patients have been treated with 130Gy. Three patients experienced hepatic toxicities, two of which are common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3. At approximately six weeks’ follow-up evaluation, all patients had stable hepatic disease. Conclusion: The maximum tolerated dose of Y90 microspheres delivered in conjunction with oral capecitabine in the setting of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic disease confined to the liver remains to be established. Combined therapy with intraarterial Y90 and oral capecitabine may offer favorable treatment responses for these patients. http://www.jvir.org/article/S1051-0443%2811%2900225-9/fulltext http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/1051-0443/PIIS1051044311002259.pdf",

No more than two prior therapies for hepatic metastatic disease, no prior hepatic radiation and no prior intervention or compromise of the Ampulla of Vater are permitted. The proposed sample size ranges from 12 to 20 patients. Subjects will be treated with sequential cycles of capecitabine for 14 days of a 21-day cycle and receive an assigned dose of Y90 between days 1 and 7 of cycle two. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be determined up to 6 weeks from Y90 infusion. The primary endpoint will be to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Y90 with capecitabine. Secondary endpoints will include evaluation of overall and hepatic response. Hepatic response will be measured with cross-sectional imaging.  url expired https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/49218-74 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/15_suppl/TPS216",

The chosen phase 2 dose of PLX3397 was 1000 mg per day. In the extension study, 12 patients with tenosynovial giant-cell tumors had a partial response and 7 patients had stable disease. Responses usually occurred within the first 4 months of treatment, and the median duration of response exceeded 8 months. The most common adverse events included fatigue, change in hair color, nausea, dysgeusia, and periorbital edema; adverse events rarely led to discontinuation of treatment. Conclusions: Treatment of tenosynovial giant-cell tumors with PLX3397 resulted in a prolonged regression in tumor volume in most patients. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26222558 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411366 May 14, 2014  J Clin Oncol 32, 2014 (suppl 15S; abstr 10503^) Presented at the 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting, May 30 - June 3, 2014, Chicago, IL Abstract No: 10503^ William D.

P. Anthony, I. Puzanov, P. S. Lin, K. B. Nolop, B. West, D. D. Von Hoff  Pharmacodynamic activity demonstrated in phase I for PLX3397, a selective inhibitor of FMS and Kit. Interim Results:  In 5 dose escalation cohorts, 26 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with PLX3397 doses of 100-900 mg daily. PK data reveal dose-dependent systemic exposure (R2=0.99) that, based on in vivo pharmacology data, exceeds the EC90 for Fms inhibition. An elimination half-life of 20 hrs enables a once-daily dosing regimen. PLX3397 was generally well tolerated, with drug-attributable toxicities (mostly grade 1) of anemia, fatigue, nausea, and rash. PD biomarkers are consistent with robust target inhibition, including a pronounced reduction in a defined subset of circulating monocytes (CD14dim/CD16+), and at higher PLX3397 systemic concentrations, a marked increase (up to 10-fold) in serum CSF-1, an activating ligand of FMS. A reduction in circulating tumor cells (CTC) has been demonstrated in 3 of 4 patients who had baseline levels > or = 5 per 7.5 mL blood. These CTC reductions were accompanied by reduced narcotic use (n=2) and skin metastasis inflammation (n=1). Additionally, hair depigmentation has been observed in 4 patients treated at 600 or 900 mg/day, indicating substantial Kit target inhibition.  Conclusions:  PLX3397 represents a novel therapeutic approach for cancer, showing dose-proportional systemic exposure clearly reaching an efficacious range for both FMS and Kit inhibition. The selectivity of PLX3397 has translated into a favorable safety profile. The first of several planned phase II trials in selected indications has been initiated in refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/85051-102 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/15_suppl/3093",

Tap  Patient-reported outcome instruments meaningful and relevant for tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT): A qualitative study. Results:  22 subjects participated: 73% female, mean age 42.5 (range 27-56); 19 (86%) diffuse, 3 (14%) localized TGCT; 50% prior surgery. Tumors were located in knee (n = 15), hip (n = 3), ankle (n = 2), elbow (n = 1), forearm (n = 1). Most common symptoms cited were pain (82%), stiffness (73%), swelling (86%), reduced range of motion (64%) and joint instability (64%), which were consistent with clinical expert input and with instruments chosen by PRO experts. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) worst pain numeric rating scale (NRS), PROMIS physical functioning items and WOMAC items identified from the literature, as well as a worst stiffness NRS developed for TGCT, were confirmed as meaningful measures of TGCT patient symptoms and were well understood in qualitative interviews. These measures are currently being piloted in an ongoing Ph1 clinical trial of PLX3397, a small molecule inhibitor of CSF1 receptor kinase, in TGCT (NCT01004861).  Conclusions:  Pain, stiffness and physical functioning are important treatment outcomes in TGCT patients. We have identified potentially reliable and valid PRO measures of these concepts, which are being tested in phase I and will be further evaluated in a phase III TGCT clinical trial with PLX3397. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/145130-156 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/15_suppl/10521 \t\t  May 14, 2014  Plexxikon Announces Promising Preliminary PLX3397 Phase 1 Extension Data in Patients with Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)  - 79 Percent of Patients Achieved Partial Response; 21 Percent Had Stable Disease with Targeted Therapy PLX3397 Plexxikon, a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group, announced today promising, proof-of-concept Phase 1 extension clinical data with PLX3397 in pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), a type of rare, often locally aggressive, musculoskeletal neoplasm that arises from the soft tissues of joints and tendons.

Durable evidence of ?IFN-secreting circulating cytotoxic T cells was observed (up to 30months from treatment start), suggesting induction of memory T effector cells. Survival correlation demonstrated significant benefit of ELISPOT “+” Vigil treated patients (median OS of 784 days, 26.1 months) compared to ELISPOT “-“ patients (median OS of 353 days, 11.77 moths), and supports immune-related survival benefit compared to MC (median OS of 122 days, 4 months), (Table). Conclusion:  Vigil immunotherapy induces a significant immune response. Detailed analysis of the immune effector population phenotype is underway to determine optimal correlation with survival.

Nemunaitis  Pilot trial of vigil immunotherapy in Ewing’s sarcoma. Interim Results:  None of the 12 patients (47 vaccinations) developed Grade 2/3/4 drug related toxicity. Median product release GMCSF expression was 1858 pg/10^6 cells; median knockdown of TGFß1 and TGFß2 was 100% and 99%, respectively. Eight patients have been sequentially assessed for circulating mononuclear cell IFN gamma-ELISPOT response, all of whom were IFNgamma-ELISPOT-ELISPOT negative at baseline. In all eight, follow up IFNgamma-ELISPOT-ELISPOT at month 1 or month 4 (one patient) post-Vigil converted to positive ( > 10 spots/10^6cells and > 2x baseline). One patient achieved a partial tumor response (38% tumor reduction, RECIST 1.1). The estimated Kaplan-Meier median survival of these 12 patients at Year 1 was 75%.  Conclusions:  In this phase 1 study in patients with Ewing’s sarcoma, Vigil immunotherapy was well tolerated, elicited a tumor-specific systemic immune response in all patients, and was associated with favorable 1-year survival.

Summary of bi-shRNA/GM-CSF Augmented Autologous Tumor Cell Immunotherapy (FANG) in Advanced Cancer of the Liver. Results: We now provide further follow-up of a subset of 8 HCC patients. FANG manufacturing was successful in 7 of 8 attempts (one failure due to insufficient cell yield). Median GM-CSF expression was 144 pg/10(6) cells, TGFß1 knockdown was 100%, and TGFß2 knockdown was 93% of the vector-transported cells. Five patients were vaccinated (1 or 2.5 × 10(7) cells/intradermal injection, 6-11 vaccinations). No FANG toxicity was observed. Three of these patients demonstrated evidence of an immune response to the autologous tumor cell sample. Long-term follow-up demonstrated survival of 319, 729, 784, 931+, and 1,043+ days of the FANG-treated patients.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, evidence supports further assessment of the FANG immunotherapy in HCC.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24968881 http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/360993 May 15, 2013  Presented at: 16th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene Therapy 2013 Abstract No: 624  John Nemunaitis, Neil Senzer, Minal Barve, Cynthia Bedell, Joseph Kuhn, Peter Beitsch, Robert Steckler, Jeffrey Lamont, Robert Hebeler, Mitchell J.

Maples  Long Term F/U – Phase I Study of the \"Triad\" Autologous (FANG) Vaccine, Incorporating Bifunctional shRNAfurin and GMCSF Transgene Expression, in Advanced Cancer Patients Interim Results:  Late stage refractory cancer patients with expected survival of 6 months or less received 1 of 2 dose levels (1x10^7 or 2.5 x10^7 cells/inj) once a month for a maximum of 12 months. Safety was confirmed and there was no evidence of a dose-response relationship; thus, the 1x10^7 cell dose per injection was identified as optimal. Tumor response, safety and immune response (gIFN ELISPOT assay) were monitored long term. We now report follow up of 33 patients treated. No new safety issues have risen in long term follow up (166 vaccinations). Long term follow up of survival of treated patients is shown below (\"+\" denotes still alive). Previously published correlation of immune response (increase gIFN ELISPOT >2x and a minimum of 3*10 spots) at Month 3 after initiation of vaccine to survival was confirmed (p=0.025). This trend still continues with a median survival of 835 days in ELISPOT positive patients compared to 440 days for ELISPOT negative patients (p=0.023). Interestingly, 2 patients who previously demonstrating negative ELISPOT response at Month 3 converted to positive response with continued treatment at later time points. In conclusion, long term follow up supports further development of FANG vaccine in advanced cancer.  http://www.abstracts2view.com/asgct/view.php?nu=ASGCT13L1_624  May 15, 2013 (Sub group Analysis) Presented at: 16th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene Therapy 2013 Abstract No: 203 Maurizio Ghisoli, Carl Lenarsky, Gladice Wallraven, Padmasini Kumar, Phillip B. Maples, John Nemunaitis Phase I Study of the \"Triad\" Autologous (FANG™) Vaccine, Incorporating Bifunctional shRNAfurin and GMCSF Transgene Expression, in Advanced Ewing's Sarcoma: Preliminary Data in Pediatrics Patients Interim Results: To date, 4 pediatric patients entered the screening process for entry into trial, 3 with relapsed Ewing's Sarcoma and 1 with progressive disease. Vaccine manufacturing was successful in 3 of the 4 harvested patients, 1 patient had insufficient viable tumor tissue. Two patients were registered into the protocol, one died from progressive disease (received one FANG™ vaccine injection). One patient who developed pulmonary metastasis one year post completion of treatment has stable disease 6 month after treatment initiation and showed activation of the ELISPOT assay. There have been no treatment-related serious adverse effects; one patient had a grade 1 treatment-related AEs limited to the skin erythema at the injection site. This limited initial data shows the safety and feasibility of this study. Updated results will be presented. http://www.abstracts2view.com/asgct/view.php?nu=ASGCT13L1_203 December 20, 2011 Mol Ther. 2012 Mar;20(3):679-86. doi: 10.1038/mt.2011.269. Epub 2011 Dec 20.

There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Most common grade 1, 2 adverse events included local induration (n = 14) and local erythema (n = 11) at injection site. Post-transfection mean product expression GMCSF increased from 7.3 to 1,108 pg/106 cells/ml. Mean TGFß1 and ß2 effective target knockdown was 93.5 and 92.5% from baseline, respectively. Positive enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) response at month 4 was demonstrated in 9 of 18 patients serially assessed and correlated with survival duration from time of treatment (P = 0.025). Neither dose–adverse event nor dose–response relationship was noted.  Conclusions: FANG vaccine was safe and elicited an immune response correlating with prolonged survival. Phase II assessment is justified. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22186789 http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/mt2011269a.html http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v20/n3/pdf/mt2011269a.pdf May 18, 2011 Presented at 14th Annual Meeting of American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, May 18-21, 2011, Seattle, WA USA  Abstract No: 505 Phillip B.

Tong, Gladice Wallraven, Joseph Kuhn, Minal Barve, Cynthia Bedell, John Nemunaitis, Neil Senzer Clinical and Manufacturing Update of the FANG Autologous Tumor Cell Vaccine Interim Results: We have treated 25 patients (9 currently on study) of which 9 patients have received 5 or more vaccine injections. The tumor types ranged from 6 colorectal, 4 melanoma, 4 ovarian, 3 hepatocellular, 2 breast, 2 sarcoma, 1 small cell lung cancer, 1 bile duct adenocarcinoma, 1 gall bladder, and 1 adenoid cystic carcinoma. The clinical results to date demonstrate that the FANGTM vaccines are safe and well tolerated. Side effects were limited to grades 1 and 2, primarily local reactions (erythema, bruising, tenderness, and induration). Possibly related were headache, iron deficiency anemia and generalized achiness. It is of interest to note that one patient with initially progressive gall bladder cancer completed the study regimen (after receiving 9 monthly injections) with stable disease.  Conclusions: Immune and clinical response evaluations are ongoing and will be reported. Gradalis has received approval from FDA to begin a Phase II FANGTM clinical trial of ovarian cancer patients in an adjuvant setting at high risk for recurrence. http://www.abstracts2view.com/asgct/view.php?nu=ASGT11L1_505",

Announces Presentation of Data from a Pilot Study of Vigil Cancer Vaccine in Ewing’s Sarcoma Dallas, June 4, 2015 – Gradalis Inc...today announced that data from a pilot study for its proprietary personalized cancer vaccine, Vigil (previously FANG), in the treatment of patients with Ewing’s sarcoma were presented in Chicago at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Data were presented in a poster session from a Phase 1 trial of 12 metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma patients who were either multiply recurrent (n=11) or had failed frontline treatment within two years (n=1). Patients received Vigil in doses of 1x10^6, 4x10^6, 1x10^7 or 2.5x10^7 cells/intradermal injection/month for at least four months. Patients were followed for safety and clinical response. Additionally, patients were monitored for tumor-specific immune response using sequential IFN?-ELISPOT (immune activation) assays to assess the functional response of cancer-targeting lymphocytes to unmodified patient-specific tumor samples, starting at baseline (pre-treatment) and sequentially after treatment. Patients were followed for safety and clinical response. None of the 12 patients (47 doses) developed Grade 2/3/4 drug related toxicity. For clinical response, one patient achieved a partial tumor response (38% tumor reduction, RECIST 1.1). The estimated Kaplan-Meier median survival of these 12 patients at year 1 was 75%. For patient immune responsiveness, median product release GM-CSF expression was 1858 pg/106 cells; median knockdown of TGFß1 and TGFß2 was 100% and 99%, respectively. Eight patients have been sequentially assessed for peripheral blood mononuclear cell IFN?-ELISPOT response, all of whom were IFN?-ELISPOT negative at baseline. In all eight, follow up IFN?-ELISPOT at month 1 or month 4 (one patient) post-Vigil converted to positive (>10 spots/106 cells and >2x baseline)...

Announces Presentation of New Data DALLAS, June 18, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gradalis Inc., a ...today announced that new data from its lead cancer programs focused on its personalized immunotherapy product were presented in May 2014 at the 50th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the 17th Annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cellular Therapy (ASGCT)... Four posters were presented at ASGC involving separate patient populations. At ASCO, safety and survival data were presented from a 3-year follow-up of 123 advanced cancer patients in a series of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, 64 of which had received the personalized immunotherapy and 53 who had not. Data demonstrated that the immunotherapy was well tolerated with only mild, local injection site adverse events. Survival benefit of those patients receiving the therapy was demonstrated and was correlated to T-cell activation against their tumor tissue. Randomized Phase 2 assessment is ongoing.1 The first poster included long term follow-up data from 74 advanced cancer patients with various tumors. Safety, T-cell activation and survival of patients were followed for over three years. The efficacy data suggested that T-cell activation against each patient's tumor initiated by the therapy correlated with patient survival justifying further efficacy testing. The Gradalis personalized immunotherapy continues to demonstrate no long-term toxicity profile with only minor injection site adverse events.2 The second poster included data in advanced hepatocellular patients and demonstrated that 3 of 5 patients receiving Gradalis' personalized immunotherapy mounted T-cell activation against their tumor tissue. Long-term follow up demonstrates survivals of 319, 729, 784, 931+ and 1043+ days of the immunotherapy treated patients. No toxicities were observed. These data justify advancement to a Phase 2 clinical study.3 In the third poster, data from a study of Gradalis' personalized immunotherapy in advanced Ewing's sarcoma was presented. Five pediatric patients had received the immunotherapy, three of whom experienced progressive disease. Two patients received 8 and 4 doses, respectively and both have stable disease. There have been no treatment-related serious adverse effects. This limited initial data shows the safety and feasibility of this study and possible clinical benefit.4 ...These data help form the basis for the Gradalis personalized immunotherapy planned Phase 3 program... ...References 1 Nemunaitis J, et al.

Fletcher;  Survival effect of bi-shRNAfurin/GMCSF DNA-based immunotherapy (FANG) in 123 advanced cancer patients to a-interferon-ELISPTOT response.  Results:  Sixty-four advanced cancer patients received monthly intradermal injections of FANG and 53 had FANG constructed but elected other therapy (No FANG group). Median survival of FANG treated patients was 729 days vs. No FANG patients 260 days, p=0.001. Patients (4%) who were ELISPOT positive at baseline or before receiving FANG or who crossed over (1%) from No FANG to FANG as part of Phase II trial were excluded. Forty-seven patients received FANG and had sequential ELISPOT analysis. Thirty-five were ELISPOT positive, and 12 were ELISPOT negative. Median survival of the FANG ELISPOT positive patients was 995 days vs. 554 days of the ELISPOT negative patients (p=0.011). No significant toxic effect was demonstrated to FANG over the three year follow up period. Seventy-one percent of the ELISPOT positive FANG treated patients were alive at 2 years and 44% were alive at 3 years. By comparison, only 25% of the FANG treated patients who were ELISPOT negative were alive at 2 years and none have reached 3 year survival.  Conclusions:  Treatment with FANG demonstrates safety and suggests survival benefit in coordination with ?-interferon ELISPOT assessment. Randomized phase II assessment is ongoing. Updated results will be presented.  http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/134213-144 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/32/15_suppl/3077 May 15, 2013  Excerpted from: FANG Personalized Tumor Vaccine Stimulates Immune Response and More than Doubles Time to Recurrence in Patients with Advanced Stage Ovarian Cancer -...Follow-Up Analysis of Phase I Data Presented at Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy... ...A follow-up analysis of the patients from the Phase I study of FANG will also be presented at the conference by John Nemunaitis , M.D., executive medical director of the Mary Crowley Cancer Research Centers and chief medical officer and co-founder of Gradalis, in a poster titled \"Long Term Follow Up – Phase I Study of the 'triad' autologous (FANG) vaccine, incorporating bifunctional shRNAfurin and GMCSF Transgene Expression in Advanced Cancer Patients.\" Long-term follow up of the 32 patients in the Phase I study with various types of late-stage cancer who received FANG showed a median survival of 562 days compared to 86 day median survival for the 23 patients who met study inclusion criteria but elected to undergo other treatment options (P < 0.000001). Based on an analysis of risk factors derived from a database of 1,181 patient assessments from the MD Anderson Clinical Center, the expected survival for patients enrolled in the FANG clinical study was between 6.2 and 8.4 months. Treatment with FANG therefore more than doubled overall survival time to 18.7 months for patients with very advanced cancer who had an otherwise poor prognosis. FANG was well tolerated by all patients, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events... http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fang-personalized-tumor-vaccine-stimulates-immune-response-and-more-than-doubles-time-to-recurrence-in-patients-with-advanced-stage-ovarian-cancer-207530021.html May 15, 2012 (Pooled Analysis) Presented at: American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy 2012 Abstract No: 199  Yang Yu, Padmasini Kumar, Fabienne Norvell, John Nemunaitis, Neil Senzer, Phillip B. Maples  HLA Typing as an Identity Test for Patients and Their FANGTM Autologous Cancer Vaccines ...To date we have analyzed 25 vaccine–blood pairs from patients on the following autologous vaccine trials (FANGTM Phase I, 4 pts; FANGTM Phase II Ovarian, 17 pts; FANGTM Phase II Melanoma, 2 pts; and TAG Phase I, 2 pts). All patient vaccine-blood pairs matched with one exception. The one exception is a Phase I FANGTM patient in whom the tumor has lost one haplotype compared to the peripheral blood MNC (had discordance between MNC and tumor at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ). DNA sequencing studies are underway to fully characterize the extent of the changes in the tumor HLA alleles as compared with peripheral blood MNC. Using HLA molecular genotyping as an identity test is quite feasible but it is also expected that a certain, albeit limited, frequency of tumors will have alterations in their HLA alleles necessitating further workup i.e. sequencing to determine the nature of their changes as well as confirmation of the matching in identity. http://www.abstracts2view.com/asgct/view.php?nu=ASGT12L1_199 March 01, 2012 Study Published in Molecular Therapy Shows that Immune Response to FANG Personalized Cancer Therapeutic Correlates with Prolonged Survival in Patients with Advanced Stage Cancer - Median survival for the FANG group was 554 days compared to 132 days for the “no FANG” group DALLAS, March 1, 2012 - Today Gradalis, Inc., announced that FANG, the company’s tumor-based personalized cancer therapeutic, elicits a robust and lasting immune response, resulting in statistically-significant prolonged survival in patients with advanced stage disease. The Phase 1 study, published today in the Nature Publishing Group journal Molecular Therapy, showed that treatment with FANG significantly increased survival in patients with advanced stage cancer compared to patients who received other forms of treatment in this non-randomized study. The study evaluated 46 patients with varying tumor types, including melanoma, colorectal, breast, ovarian and hepatocellular cancers. A personalized FANG vaccine was manufactured from tumors removed from 42 of the 46 patients, and 27 patients received one monthly dose of the vaccine for up to 12 months. Twenty-three of the 27 patients receiving FANG achieved stable disease within two months of dose initiation. Median survival for the FANG group was 554 days compared to 132 days for the group that did not receive FANG. (P < 0.0001) The “no FANG” group included 18 patients who had vaccine made but did not receive injections due to progression of disease or pursuit of other treatment options. FANG was well tolerated by all patients, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events... ...Eighteen patients who received FANG were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays to determine the extent of their cellular immune response to the FANG vaccine. Positive ELISPOT responses at four months were demonstrated in nine of the 18 patients evaluated, and this response was correlated to survival benefit (p = 0.025). Positive immune response to FANG is durable, as seven of the nine ELISPOT responders were still alive when the manuscript was accepted for publication, having survival up to 500 days since start of treatment. Routine, post-treatment monitoring of this patient group reveals that these seven patients are still alive today with survival ranging from 464 to 940 days... http://mywebsitepronto.com/clients/gradalis/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Study-Published-in-Molecular-Therapy-Shows-that-Immune-Response-to-FANG-Correlates-with-Prolonged-Survival-in-Patients-with-Advanced-Stage-Cancer.pdf January 10, 2012 Clinical study confirms Benitec’s gene-silencing technology is safe and effective in Gradalis’ cancer vaccine The Directors of Benitec Biopharma Ltd are pleased to announce the publication in Molecular Therapy by researchers from US-based Gradalis Inc. and academic research centres, of completed Phase I clinical trial results of a novel cancer vaccine (FANG) which in part utilised Benitec Biopharma’s patented gene-silencing technology, DNA-directed RNA interference (ddRNAi). The trial evaluated the vaccine in patients with advanced or metastatic non-curable solid tumours, including melanoma, colon, breast, liver, bile duct and colon cancers. The patients received up to twelve monthly intradermal injections of FANG vaccine. The investigators concluded that “the vaccine was safe and elicited an immune response correlating with prolonged survival... ...In summary, the trial results demonstrated: - That the ddRNAi component (a bi-shRNA molecule) was effective at significantly reducing the immunosuppressive cytokines TGF cytokines TGF-ß1 and -ß2 by up to 93.5% and 92.5%, respectively - That the GM-CSF gene component of the vaccine was effective at boosting the proimmune cytokine GM-CSF. - The combined approach of inhibiting expression of immunosuppressive TGF-ß isoforms via a bi-shRNA-mediated knock- down along with an integrated GMCSF + RNAi treatment was feasible and effective - That despite this being a Phase 1 study, there was a significant survival advantage seen for those cancer patients who had 4 or more treatments of the FANG vaccine compared to those who had fewer or no treatments. - The safety and tolerability of the FANG vaccine as shown by the lack of any treatment-related serious adverse effects...

Median number of prior antineoplastic therapies: 5 (range: 1–12) for patients with PIK3CA-altered tumors and 5 (range: 4–16) for patients with PIK3CA-wt tumors. Prior fulvestrant treatment: 19 (46%) and 7 (44%) patients with PIK3CA-altered and -wt tumors, respectively. Overall, the most common (>or=25%) adverse events (AEs; all grades/all doses) suspected to be study drug-related were hyperglycemia (41%), diarrhea (34%), nausea (30%), and vomiting (25%). The most common (>10%) study drug-related Grade 3/4 AEs (all doses) were maculopapular rash (14%) and hyperglycemia (13%). Preliminary antitumor activity was observed in this trial. At data cut-off, partial responses (PRs) were observed in 2 patients with PIK3CA-altered tumors evaluable for response (2/33, 6%), but no PRs were observed in the 15 evaluable patients with PIK3CA-wt tumors. Duration of exposure was >16 weeks in 24 (59%) patients with PIK3CA-altered tumors and in 5 (31%) patients with PIK3CA-wt tumors. PK and exposure of BYL719 + fulvestrant was similar to that observed with single-agent BYL719 at the same dose levels. At data cut-off, treatment was ongoing in 20 (49%) and 2 (13%) patients with PIK3CA-altered and -wt tumors, respectively.  Conclusion:  BYL719 + fulvestrant demonstrated a favorable safety profile in patients with PIK3CA-altered and -wt ER+/HER2– BC, with mostly on-target effects (i.e. hyperglycemia, rash). Preliminary clinical activity was seen in patients with PIK3CA-altered and -wt tumors, but confirmed PRs were only observed in patients with PIK3CA-altered tumors. The low number of patients with PIK3CA-wt tumors limits further conclusion.  http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs14/view.php?nu=SABCS13L_816   September 26, 2014  Annals of Oncology 25 (supplement 4), September 2014 Presented at  Madrid 2014 ESMO Congress, September 26 - 30 2014 Madrid, Spain Abstract No: 451PD  D.

Blumenstein and J. Baselga  Phase I Study Of The PI3Ka Inhibitor Byl719, As A Single Agent In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors  Interim Results:  As of Mar 10, 2014, 132 pts received BYL719 QD (30–450 mg) or BID (120, 150, 200 mg). Median exposure was 11.9 (0.4–98) wks. DLTs were reported in: 4 pts (hyperglycemia x2, nausea x2) at 450 mg QD, 4 pts (hyperglycemia x4) at 200 mg BID, and 1 pt (hyperglycemia and hypophosphatemia) at 150 mg BID. BYL719 QD MTD is 400 mg (and was used for dose expansion); here, BYL719 BID MTD is declared as 150 mg. Most common (=20%) suspected study drug-related all-Grade AEs at the MTDs were: BYL719 150 mg BID (n = 15) – hyperglycemia, nausea (both 53%), diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, stomatitis (all 33%); and BYL719 400 mg QD (n = 63 including dose expansion) – hyperglycemia (51%), nausea (48%), diarrhea (41%), decreased appetite (38%), fatigue (32%), vomiting (30%), rash (20%). Overall, 15 of 131 evaluable pts had partial responses (PRs; incl. 2 [out of 24 pts] with PIK3CA-altered ER+ BC); 7 PRs were confirmed: 2 at 270 mg QD, 1 at 350 mg QD, 2 at 400 mg QD, 2 at 150 mg BID. Disease control rates (CR, PR, or SD) at MTDs were: BYL719 400 mg QD – 53%; and BYL719 150 mg BID – 67%. Median PFS at =270 mg in ER+ HER2– BC (n = 21) was 166 days. In pts with PIK3CA wt ER+ BC (n = 5) duration of exposure range was 7–61 days; no PRs were observed in wt pts. Conclusions:  BYL719 is the first a isoform-specific PI3K inhibitor to show single-agent responses in tumors with activating mutations. The safety profile was favorable with mostly on-target effects (i.e. hyperglycemia). Data comparing PIK3CA-altered and wt ER + /HER2– BC pts will be presented.

Preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of BYL719, an alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant: Results from a phase I study Interim Results:  At the data cut-off (27 March 2013), 4 pts were enrolled in the initial cohort of 300 mg/q.d. BYL719 plus 500 mg/qmonth (with an additional dose at week 2) fulvestrant, followed by 8 pts into the subsequent 400 mg/q.d. BYL719 plus fulvestrant dose combination. No pts experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the 300 mg cohort, and 1 pt experienced a DLT of CTCAE grade 3 diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia and bloating in the 400 mg cohort. The MTD of BYL719 in combination with fulvestrant has been declared as 400 mg/q.d. The most frequent BYL719 related toxicities (>15% pts), regardless of grade and treatment group, are diarrhea (42%), hyperglycemia (33%), decreased appetite (25%), nausea (25%), and fatigue (17%). Systemic drug exposure of oral BYL719 when given in combination with fulvestrant was found to be similar to the single agent data. The patients were typically pre-treated with numerous chemotherapy, hormonal or targeted therapies. One pt in the 300 mg/q.d. cohort had a confirmed partial response, and 2 pts in the 400 mg/q.d. cohort had a partial response (one confirmed and one only occurring after the data cut-off). From the 12 breast cancer pts treated, 2 (17%) discontinued treatment due to progressive disease, and the median exposure of all pts at the time of data cut-off was 9 weeks. Conclusions:  This combination displays a favorable safety and PK profile, both comparable to the single agent BYL719 experience. BYL719 in combination with fulvestrant shows encouraging preliminary anti-tumor activity, which supports further investigation of this combination. Recruitment within the dose expansion is continuing to obtain a sample size of 20 patients carrying the PIK3CA mutation. http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs13/view.php?nu=SABCS13L_1499 May 16, 2013  J Clin Oncol 31, 2013 (suppl; abstr 2531) Presented at: American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO 2013 Abstract No: 2531  Ana M.

Schuler, Robin Van Geel, Thorunn Helgason, Douglas Bootle, Markus Boehm, Timothy K. Goggin, David Demanse, Cornelia Quadt, Jose Baselga Safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of the a-specific PI3K inhibitor BYL719: Results from the first-in-human study. Interim Results:  During dose escalation 36 pts received doses up to 450 mg/d, where 4/9 pts had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The MTD for once-daily dosing was declared as 400 mg/d. As of Nov 20 2012, DLTs were hyperglycemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The most common BYL719-related adverse events (all grades, all cohorts, >25%) were hyperglycemia (49%), nausea (45%), diarrhea (40%), decreased appetite (38%), vomiting (30%), and fatigue (27%). 39 pts are enrolled in the MTD dose-expansion cohort. Investigation of a twice-daily regimen is also ongoing. BYL719 has a favorable, approximately dose-proportional PK profile with a Tmax of 2h and a T½ of 11h at the MTD. Partial responses were seen in 7 pts (in ER+ breast [2], cervical, trichilemmal, endometrial, ovarian, and head &neck cancer [1 each]); 17 pts stayed on study for >24 weeks. For 67 pts (76%) treated at doses of > or = 270 mg/d, the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 3.6 months (mo; 95% CI: 3.5–5.5 mo). mPFS in 15 ER+ HER2– mBC pts treated at > or = 270 mg/d was 5.5 mo (95% CI: 3–7 mo).  Conclusions:  BYL719 displays dose-proportional and predictable PK. The safety profile is favorable, with mostly manageable on-target toxicities. At doses of > or = 270 mg/d, tumor regression and prolonged disease control were observed in heavily pretreated pts with various tumor types carrying a PIK3CA mutation. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/114843-132 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/15_suppl/2531 December 4, 2012  Presented at the 35th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, December 4-8, 2012, San Antonio, TX Abstract Number: P6-10-07 Juric D, Argiles G, Burris HA, Gonzalez-Angulo AM, Saura C, Quadt C, Douglas M, Demanse D, De Buck S, Baselga J Phase I Study of BYL719, an Alpha-Specific PI3K Inhibitor, in Patients with PIK3CA Mutant Advanced Solid Tumors: Preliminary Efficacy and Safety in Patients with PIK3CA Mutant ER-Positive (ER+) Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Interim Results: 20 patients with ER+ PIK3CA mutant MBC were treated once daily with BYL719 at doses of 30 mg (n=1), 180 mg (n=1), 270 mg (n=1), 400 mg (n=14) and 450 mg (n=3). Median age was 55 years (range 40-78). 15/20 patients with ER+ PIK3CA mutant MBC had HER2 negative and 5/20 had HER2+ MBC. Patients had received a median of 5 previous treatment regimens (range 1-11). Most patients had received multiple prior lines of endocrine therapy including tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors; 9 patients also received fulvestrant and 16 patients received prior chemotherapy. HER2+ patients have been previously treated with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib. Based on a recent analysis of 19 patients (data cut-off 5 July 2012), the safety of BYL719 in patients with ER+ MBC was comparable to the overall study population. Most frequent adverse events (AEs; =10%) suspected to be related to BYL719 were hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, decreased appetite, vomiting, rash and erythematous rash, dysgeusia, dry mouth, and stomatitis. The majority of AEs were CTCAE grade 1/2 and were clinically well manageable. Most frequent CTCAE grade 3/4 events were hyperglycemia and erythematous rash. 18/20 PIK3CA mutant ER+ MBC patients were treated at potentially effective doses of > or = 270 mg/day. 6/18 patients (33%) achieved tumor shrinkage > 20%, among them 2 patients achieved partial responses (PR) by RECIST. Median progression free survival (PFS) analyzed in 17 patients treated at > or = 270 mg/day in the ER+ BC patients was 7.3 months (CI [4.6,9.5]), compared to 3.7 months (CI [1.8,5.5]) in 38 patients with other PIK3CA mutant solid tumors (data cut-off 5 July 2012) Conclusion: BYL719 has a favorable safety profile with manageable side effects, which were mainly related to its mechanism of action. BYL719 shows promising preliminary clinical activity as single agent in patients with PIK3CA mutant ER+ MBC, warranting further clinical development. The investigation of BYL719 continues in patients with ER+ MBC as single agent, and in combination with endocrine therapy. http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs12/view.php?nu=SABCS12L_3046 March 31, 2012  Cancer Research: April 15, 2012; Volume 72, Issue 8, Supplement 1  Presented at the 103rd AACR Annual Meeting, March 31 - April 4, 2012, Chicago, IL Abstract no: CT-01  Dejan Juric, Jordi Rodon, Ana M.

Middleton, Douglas Bootle, Markus Boehm, Antonin Schmitt, Nicolas Rouyrre, Cornelia Quadt, Jose Baselga  BYL719, a next generation PI3K alpha specific inhibitor: Preliminary safety, PK, and efficacy results from the first-in-human study Interim Results:  The safety profile of the compound is characterized by mostly on-target toxicity, such as hyperglycemia (33% of pts), which was found more frequently at higher doses and is largely reversible with BYL719 interruption and treatment with oral anti-diabetics. Other commonly reported toxicities include nausea (38%) and decreased appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting (each 29%). 2 DLTs of hyperglycemia and nausea, both CTCAE grade 3, were observed in 2 pts out of 5 treated at 450mg/d. In humans, BYL719 has a low clearance, a half-life of 8.5 h and its exposure increases dose proportionally between 30mg/d and 450mg/d, displaying a low inter-individual variability in Cmax and AUC. Exposure levels reached at clinical doses above 270 mg/d correspond to exposures causing tumor stasis or regression in preclinical PIK3CA dependent xenograft models. First signs of clinical efficacy of BYL719 include 1 confirmed partial response in a patient with ER+ breast cancer treated at 270mg/d. In addition, preliminary data suggest that significant PET responses (PMR) and/or tumor shrinkage were achieved in 8 out of 17 evaluated pts. Three pts had prolonged stable disease (=7 months) at doses below 270mg/d and overall 8 patients have been on the study for at least 4 months. Upon determination of the MTD for the once daily dosing regimen, ~45 pts with PIK3CA altered solid tumors will be enrolled into a safety expansion arm. Also, the PK and MTD for twice daily administration of BYL719 will be investigated. Conclusion:  The preliminary clinical data available so far suggest BYL719 to be well tolerated, and showing signs of clinical activity, with manageable side effects and a predictable PK profile.  http://www.abstractsonline.com/plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=2898&sKey=d14acbff-7602-45e9-a577-11db6325068e&cKey=04a16b3b-4956-4cf9-833f-b223331f46b4&mKey={2D8C569E-B72C-4E7D-AB3B-070BEC7EB280} http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/short/72/8_MeetingAbstracts/CT-01?rss=1",

Preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of BYL719, an alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant: Results from a phase I study Results:  Patient Demographics and Characteristics Overall, 34 postmenopausal women with ER+, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer received BYL719 + fulvestrant in this Phase I study (Twenty-eight (82%) patients had tumors carrying  PIK3CA mutations (Table 2). – Six (18%) patients had tumors with a wild-type  PIK3CA gene. – One (3%) patient had a tumor with PIK3CA amplification. Twenty-six (76%) of 34 patients had received some form of chemotherapy; 23 (68%) had received prior  paclitaxel, 9 (26%) had received prior docetaxel. All patients had received =2 prior lines of therapy, including aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen; 13 (38%) patients had received prior fulvestrant.  As of the data cut-off (September 2, 2013), study treatment has been discontinued in 19 (56%) patients and was ongoing in 15 (44%) patients. Primary reasons for treatment discontinuation were: – Disease progression (12 [35%] patients; 3 [9%] and 9 [26%] in the 300 and 400 mg/day BYL719 +  fulvestrant groups, respectively). – AE (4 [12%] patients in the 400 mg/day BYL719 + fulvestrant group). – Withdrawal of consent (2 [6%] patients in the 400 mg/day BYL719 + fulvestrant group). – Administrative problems (1 [3%] patients in the 400 mg/day BYL719 + fulvestrant group). Dose-Limiting Toxicities During dose-escalation, 4 patients were treated with 300 mg/day BYL719 + fulvestrant and 11 patients were treated with 400 mg/day BYL719 + fulvestrant. Of 10 evaluable patients, 1 patient in the 400 mg/day BYL719 + fulvestrant group experienced dose-limiting toxicities of CTCAE Grade 3 diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and anorexia. The MTD of BYL719 in combination with fulvestrant was declared as 400 mg/day. Safety and Tolerability The median duration of exposure to BYL719 was 7.9 weeks (range 3 to >41 weeks) ( Overall, 30 (88%) patients received the MTD of BYL719; 11 in the dose-escalation phase and 19 in the dose-expansion phase. – Seven (21%) patients received treatment on the study for at least 24 weeks. The most frequent (>20%) AEs suspected to be study drug related are presented in Hyperglycemia and nausea (all Grade) were the most common, each being observed in 12 (35%) patients. – Other common AEs (all grade) suspected to be study drug related were diarrhea (32%), decreased appetite (29%), vomiting (24%), and maculopapular rash (21%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 AEs suspected to be study drug related were hyperglycemia (15%), maculopapular rash (15%), and generalized rash (6%). Other Grade 3/4 AEs suspected to be study drug related were rare (0–3%). AEs requiring dose interruption and/or reduction were reported in 17 (50%) patients. Additional cohorts of BYL719 dosed marginally below the MTD are ongoing to establish the full safety profile at dose levels within the therapeutic window. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic profile of BYL719 in combination with fulvestrant in patients with PIK3CA -altered, ER+, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer was similar to that observed in the single-agent portion of the study. Preliminary Clinical Activity Twenty-five (74%) patients were evaluable for radiologic response (i.e. had undergone at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment)  Three (12%) patients achieved a confirmed partial response; 2 (8%) of whom were in the BYL719 400 mg/day + fulvestrant group ( Ten (40%) patients had stable disease, including 1 (4%) patient in the BYL719 400 mg/day + fulvestrant group with an unconfirmed partial response. Median PFS was 176 days (95% CI 160 days-not estimated) CONCLUSIONS BYL719 in combination with fulvestrant demonstrated a favorable safety profile in patients with PIK3CA -altered, ER+, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and was similar to that observed with single-agent BYL719. The MTD of BYL719 in combination with fulvestrant given as a once-daily dose was declared as 400 mg/day. BYL719 + fulvestrant showed encouraging preliminary clinical activity in patients with PIK3CA -altered locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Three patients achieved a confirmed partial response and 10 patients achieved stable disease. – Median PFS was 176 days.

Garraway, Roman Yelensky, Philip J. Stephens, Vincent A. Miller, Robert Schlegel, Cornelia Quadt, José Baselga Towards defining the genetic framework for clinical response to treatment with BYL719, a PI3Kalpha-specific inhibitor  Results: In this study, we applied massive parallel sequencing to tumor specimens from patients enrolled in the BYL719 FIM trial to comprehensively assess the genetic determinants of clinical sensitivity to BYL719. Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed archival or pre-treatment tumor specimens were obtained from 44 patients with advanced solid tumors upon enrolment into the clinical trial. DNA was isolated and then assayed by massive parallel sequencing covering either a panel of 182 cancer-related genes at Foundation Medicine or the whole exome at the Broad Institute. Mutations were identified by focusing on genes with alterations in the COSMIC data base and excluding germline variants and were subsequently correlated with clinical benefit as defined by stable disease > or = 4 months, tumor shrinkage > or = 20% or objective tumor response to BYL719 using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Focusing on a panel of 51 genes with known relevance to PI3K signaling, we observed that all pre-treatment tumor samples harbored at least one genetic abnormality and that each of the genes was altered in one or several tumor samples. TP53 (59%), APC (25%), KRAS (23%) and PTEN (18%) were the most frequently altered in addition to PIK3CA. Alterations in TP53 and KRAS were identified as statistically significant negative predictors of BYL719 sensitivity (p < 0.05), while mutations in the APC and PTEN genes were associated with a trend towards lack of benefit from treatment with BYL719. Conclusions:  Our results suggest that definition of the genetic biomarkers that govern sensitivity to treatment with BYL719 and--most likely--other PI3Ka inhibitors in the clinic is possible upon analysis of patient’s tumors by massive parallel sequencing. We also demonstrate that it is feasible to routinely obtain this information in the clinical trial setting. This implies that exploration of the genetic determinants driving sensitivity or primary resistance to targeted agents in general can now be undertaken clinically. http://www.abstractsonline.com/plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=3086&sKey=1e9ae007-6c50-46e2-951f-4b825865e743&cKey=c8c4d9c2-080d-4edd-8300-b7577cc2de4c&mKey={9B2D28E7-24A0-466F-A3C9-07C21F6E9BC9} http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/73/8_MeetingAbstracts/LB-65 December 4, 2012  Actual Accrual: N = 79 patients as of 5 September 2012 as per SABCS 2012 http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs12/view.php?nu=SABCS12L_3046 N = 25 patients as of September 21, 2011  http://www.abstractsonline.com/plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=2898&sKey=d14acbff-7602-45e9-a577-11db6325068e&cKey=04a16b3b-4956-4cf9-833f-b223331f46b4&mKey={2D8C569E-B72C-4E7D-AB3B-070BEC7EB280} December 04, 2012 Excerted From: Sarah Cannon Research Institute Investigators Author 11 Studies for Presentation at San Antonia Breast Cancer Symposium NASHVILLE, TN., Dec. 4, 2012 – Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) investigators are authors on 11 clinical trial abstracts accepted for presentation during the 2012 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, which takes place Dec. 4-8. “We are excited to share SCRI's research efforts with our scientific colleagues at this important breast cancer conference,” SCRI Chief Medical Officer Howard A.

The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were skin rash (89%), elevated ALT (41%)/AST (37%), hyper-pigmentation (41%) and diarrhea (30%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 AEs were elevations in ALT (19%), gamma-GGT (11%), AST (7%), hyperbilirubinemia (7%) and skin rash (4%). There have been no Grade 5 AEs to date. Among the 24 efficacy evaluable patients (11 TKI pretreated, 13 TKI naive), 7 (7/24, 29%) achieved a partial response (PR), including 1 unconfirmed PR. All PRs occurred in EGFR TKI treatment naïve patients (7/13, 53.8%). Of the 24 evaluable patients, 8 (5 EGFR TKI treatment naïve, 3 EGFR TKI pretreated) had measurable brain metastasis (lesion diameter>10 mm per RECIST 1.1) with 2 PRs (both EGFR TKI treatment naïve patients, 2/5, 40%). Conclusion:  Epitinib 160mg per day treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with brain metastasis demonstrated clinical activity both extra- and intra-cranial. Epitinib was well tolerated. The data to date appears encouraging and warrants further development of epitinib.

No DLT was observed. Although MTD was not reached, 160 mg q.d. was selected as the RP2D. The most common AEs were skin rash (60.0%), diarrhea (34.3%), elevated AST (34.3%)/ALT (31.4%) and hyperbilirubinemia (28.6%). AEs of Elevated AST (2.9%)/ALT (2.9%) and hyperbilirubinemia(5.7%) were grade 3. Among 34 evaluable patients, one (2.9%) patient (80 mg cohort, EGFRm+ and TKI naive) reached PR with a duration of response over 36 months. Epitinib drug exposure increased proportionally up to 160 mg and appeared to plateau above 160 mg. The average T 1/2 ranged between38 and54h. A dose expansion study in EGFRm+ NSCLC patients with brain metastases is ongoing. As of 30 Oct, 2015, 12 patients were treated with epitinib at 160 mg q.d. Among 12 evaluable patients, 5 reached PR (all treatment naive) and showed dramatic shrinkage of brain lesions. The rest 5 prior -TKI treated patients had SD in the brain. 2 progression events observed with one in liver and the other in brain, respectively. Conclusions:  Epitinib was well tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors. Its safety profile is consistent to EGFR-TKIs. The RP2D of 160 mg q.d. was selected based on safety, PK and preliminary efficacy data. Clear clinical efficacy was observed in untreated EGFRm+ NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Taken together, these data support further development of epitinib for the treatment of EGFRm+ NSCLC patients with brain metastasis. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/168012-176 May 16, 2013 J Clin Oncol 31, 2013 (suppl; abstr e19042) Presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO 2013 Abstract No: e19042  Qing Zhou, Yi Long Wu, Xiyong Yu, Jinji Yang, Limin Wen, Yang Sai, Hua MU  Phase I study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of epitinib, an oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors.  Interim Results:  By Dec 31, 2012, 19 patients aged 40-66 yr old (ECOG PS 1) with NSCLC (n=16) or breast cancer (n=3) were enrolled in 5 dose cohorts of 20-160 mg. Six NSCLC patients had EGFR mutations (3 with T790M). All patients had > or = 2 lines of prior systemic treatments (7 patients with gefitinib or elotinib). Most AEs were mild (Gr1). Treatment-related AEs included skin rash (36.8%), abnormal liver function tests (42.1%), diarrhea (10.5%), vomiting (5.3%), paronychia (5.3%), decreased neutrophil count (5.3%) and increased creatinine (5.3%). Three SAEs were reported as possibly unrelated to the study drug. No DLT was observed and MTD has not been reached yet. PK analysis showed that the mean elimination half-life of Epitinib was approximately 40 hours and Tmax was around 2 h. Both Cmaxand AUC exhibited good dose proportionality over the studied dose range with low inter-patient variability following single and multiple doses. Among 15 evaluable patients, 1 EGFR mutation+ NSCLC patient achieved confirmed partial response (66.7% tumor reduction) for more than 6 months and the treatment is ongoing; 8 patients had stable disease, including 1 with T790M for 6 months and 1 with brain metastasis for 12 months who is still on treatment.  Conclusions:  Epitinib was well tolerated at doses up to 160mg QD to date with manageable adverse events and excellent pharmacokinetic properties. Encouraging clinical activity was observed, including durable SD in NSCLC patients with T790M or brain mets.  http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/114269-132 [URL not working] http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/15_suppl/e19042",

FN had more visceral disease (83.3% vs 66.7%) and ER+/PR– status (25% vs 8.3%) than FR. Median number of prior anticancer regimens was 4.5 (range 1–9) and 6 (2–11) in FN and FR, respectively, with more chemotherapy (CT) and less hormone therapy (HT) exposure in FN vs FR [3 (0–5) vs 2 (0–6) and 2 (0–4) vs 4 (2–6) prior CT and HT, respectively]. Prior palbociclib was received by 1 (8.3%) and 4 (33.3%) patients in FN and FR, respectively. Clinical efficacy is detailed below; CBR was 33% and 42% in FN and FR, respectively (Table 1). There was 1 unconfirmed partial response in patients treated with prior palbociclib and 3 SD. At data cut-off, 18 patients had discontinued treatment: progressive disease, n = 12; adverse events (AEs), n = 2; other reasons, n = 4. AEs were observed in all 24 patients, most commonly diarrhea (71%), nausea (63%), vomiting and decreased appetite (29%). Grade > or = 3 AEs occurred in 13 (54%) patients, most frequently maculopapular rash (n = 3), nausea, hyperglycemia and back pain (all n = 2). Dose reduction due to AEs occurred in 3 pts Conclusions: AZD5363 plus fulvestrant is clinically active in AKT1m ER+ MBC pts, including in pts with demonstrated prior resistance to fulvestrant. Comparatively lower efficacy was observed in the FN cohort; factors that may have potentially contributed (eg disease characteristics) will be explored. cfDNA and genomic data will also be presented.

Berger, Sarat Chandarlapaty Serial next generation sequencing (NGS) of cell free DNA (cfDNA) and clonal evolution of AKT1 E17K mutant tumors: Analyses from patients (pts) enrolled on a phase I basket study of an AKT inhibitor (AZD5363) Interim Results:  From October 2014 to December 2015, 24 patients had cfDNA extracted from 82 plasma samples for NGS. Mean sequencing coverage was 436. cfDNA was AKT1 E17K mut +ve in 22/24 (92%) patients by ddPCR and NGS. MAFAKT by NGS and ddPCR was highly concordant (r= 0.98; p<2.2e-16). MAFAKT by ddPCR could be correlated with tumor response, with durable RECIST responses seen in 5/5 (100%) patients with persistent (>21 days) cfDNA clearance. The most frequently mutated genes in addition to AKT1 were ESR1 (27%), TP53 (23%) and GATA3 (18%) with an average of 4 muts per pt. Pre-Tx cfDNA NGS revealed muts not observed in the archival specimen in 4/9 (44%) patients. 7 muts emerged on NGS of on-study and progression cfDNA, which were not observed or found at low abundance in pre-Tx cfDNA, including muts in GRIN2A, TP53 and CEBPA, among others. Second site muts in AKT1 were not observed.  Conclusions:  Serial NGS of cfDNA is feasible and highly concordant with ddPCR. Throughout therapy with an AKTi, the AKT1 E17K alteration appears to be clonal, however, serial NGS can identify emergent genomic alterations.  http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/165830-176 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/15_suppl/11500 May 13, 2015 J Clin Oncol 33, 2015 (suppl; abstr 2500) Presented at the 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting, May 29 – June 2, 2015, Chicago, IL  Abstract No: 2500 Udai Banerji, Emma Jane Dean, Jose Alejandro Perez-Fidalgo, Gerald Batist, Philippe L.

M. Schellens A pharmacokinetically (PK) and pharmacodynamically (PD) driven phase I trial of the pan-AKT inhibitor AZD5363 with expansion cohorts in PIK3CA mutant breast and gynecological cancers. Interim Results: 47, 21 and 22 patients were treated on the 7/7, 4/7 and 2/7 schedules respectively, with a further 27 and 18 patients recruited to the B and G cohorts to date. The MTDs of 7/7, 4/7 and 2/7 were 320mg BID, 480mg BID and 640mg BID respectively. The dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were rash and diarrhea for 7/7, and hyperglycemia for 2/7. No DLTs were identified for 4/7. The most common causally-related adverse events > or = CTC Grade 3 were hyperglycemia (20%), diarrhea (10%), rash (10%), nausea (3%) and fatigue (1%). PK profiles at the RP2D of 480mg BID (4/7) showed a multi-dose Css,max of 1426ng/mL and AUCssof 7952ng.hr/mL, which were consistent with exposures that gave tumor regression in preclinical models. Pre- and post-treatment biopsies confirmed target engagement in tumor tissue, with an increase in pAKT and reductions in pGSK3ß and pPRAS40. Based on toxicity, PK and PD profiles 480mg BID (4/7) was chosen as the R2PD for single agent AZD5363, with the option of using 640mg BID (2/7) as a pharmacologically active dose for future combination studies. Target lesion shrinkage was observed in 7/15 and 4/14 in the B and G cohorts respectively to date, and with RECIST responses in evaluable patients of 3/15 (20%) and 1/14 (7%). Conclusion: Based on toxicity, PK and PD data two intermittent schedules of AZD5363 have been identified for further exploration. Promising single agent activity has been seen in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer providing support for ongoing combination studies http://abstracts.asco.org/156/AbstView_156_146991.html ",

Harrington and J. Carl Barrett  Pharmacodynamic activity of the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 in patients with advanced solid tumors.  Results:  Paired tumour biopsies at baseline and after approximately 2 weeks dosing were obtained from patients on continuous and intermittent dosing schedules. Inhibition of GSK3ß and PRAS40 phosphorylation of >30% or >50% respectively was seen in 4/7 (GSK3ß) and 2/8 (PRAS40) tumours at tolerated doses of AZD5363. Phospho-AKT was increased in 4/7 (AKT-Thr308) and 4/5 (AKT-Ser473) tumours commensurate with the mechanism of action of AZD5363. Hair follicle PRAS40 phosphorylation was reduced by >50% in 22/71 patients and showed evidence of an exposure related response with an IC50 of 2µM total plasma concentration. Blood glucose also demonstrated an exposure response relationship with maximum glucose concentration correlating with drug plasma Cmax.  Conclusions:  Inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation in tumour biopsies from advanced cancer patients with a range of solid tumours was qualitatively comparable to that observed in preclinical models showing tumour growth inhibition at clinically achievable exposures.  http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/131652-144 [This URL has expired] http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/32/15_suppl/2541 December 31, 2013  Development Pipeline  Compound:AZD5363  Mechanism: AKT inhibitor  Area Under Investigation: solid tumours  Phase: I  Date Commenced Phase: 4Q 2010  [This URL has expired] http://www.astrazeneca.com/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&blobheadername2=MDT-Type&blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3DDevelopment-pipeline-table.pdf&blobheadervalue2=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1285664659458&ssbinary=true  April 6, 2013 [Pooled Analysis]  Presented at the 104th AACR Annual Meeting, April 6-10, 2013, Washington, DC  Abstract no: LB-66  Udai Banerji, Malcolm Ranson, Jan HM Schellens, Taito Esaki, Emma Dean, Andrea Zivi, Ruud Van der Noll, Paul K. Stockman, Marcelo Marotti, Michelle D. Garrett, Barry R. Davies, Paul Elvin, Andrew Hastie, Peter Lawrence, SY Amy Cheung, Christine Stephens, Kenji Tamura  Results of two phase I multicenter trials of AZD5363, an inhibitor of AKT1, 2 and 3: Biomarker and early clinical evaluation in Western and Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors  Results:  At data cut-off (January 2013), 92 patients had been treated in the dose-escalation phases of both studies. In the Western study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each schedule was 320 mg bid (7/7) and 480 mg bid intermittent dosing (4/7). In the Japanese study, 320 mg bid (7/7) was not tolerated; the MTD for intermittent dosing (4/7) was 480 mg bid. The most commonly reported adverse events, of note, were hyperglycemia, rash, and diarrhea. The PK profile suggests a dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC. Exposures achieved at doses of 320 mg bid (7/7) and 480 mg bid (4/7) and above are consistent with activity seen in xenograft models. At the doses described, target engagement was seen as evidenced by PD changes in normal tissue (>50% reduction in pPRAS40 in 7/10 patients on AZD5363 480 mg bid (4/7) in plucked hair samples and 30-50% reduction in pPRAS40 and >30% reduction in pGSK3ß in platelet rich plasma). Importantly, 7/9 paired biopsies showed an increase in pAKT consistent with the non allosteric inhibition of AKT. Investigation of another intermittent schedule of AZD5363 bid, 2 days on/5 days off treatment, is ongoing. Exploratory mutation analyses of plasma samples are ongoing. Two partial responses were observed, one endometrioid cancer of the ovary and one cervical cancer, in patients on AZD5363 at 480 mg bid (4/7) and 400 mg bid (7/7), respectively. Mutation of either AKT1 or PIK3CA was identified in tumor tissue from both patients. A further patient, with endometrioid cancer of ovary (PIK3CA mutation), had stable disease (SD) for 156 days.  Conclusions:  AZD5363 administered at 480 mg bid (4/7) was generally well tolerated and showed a PK and PD profile consistent with activity in preclinical models. Partial responses were noted in patients with mutations driving the PI3K pathway.  http://www.abstractsonline.com/plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=3086&sKey=1e9ae007-6c50-46e2-951f-4b825865e743&cKey=54fe4581-6607-41e3-91c3-f5df20de4588&mKey={9B2D28E7-24A0-466F-A3C9-07C21F6E9BC9}  April 03, 2013 Astex Pharmaceuticals Pipeline Data Presentations at AACR DUBLIN, Calif., April 3, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc...today announced the acceptance of thirteen abstracts covering internal and partner funded pipeline product data for poster or oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting April 6 to 10, 2013 in Washington, DC... ...Two of the four partner funded programs in our portfolio will have data supporting ongoing clinical development: AZD5363, a PKB/Akt inhibitor: Results of Two Phase I Multicenter Trials of AZD5363, an Inhibitor of AKT1, 2 and 3: Biomarker and Early Clinical Evaluation in Western and Japanese Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Abstract LB-66, Sunday, Apr 7, 3:30 - 3:50 pm ET, oral presentation... http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-FFK19/2287156777x0x650775/5970c17c-9e7e-4c94-ab87-99d440fbc1ed/ASTX_News_2013_4_3_General_Releases.pdf March 18, 2013 Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc, Form; 10-K ...Non-Prioritized Clinical Programs ...AZD5363-PKB/Akt Inhibitor ...In April 2011, AstraZeneca announced that it had commenced a Phase I study of AZD5363 in patients with advanced solid tumors, and the compound is now being tested in four Phase I and Phase I/II clinical trials...

[Epub ahead of print] Published online: October 27, 2017Accepted: October 18, 2017Received in revised form:October 12, 2017Received: May 30, 2017 McRee AJ, Marcom PK, Moore DT, Zamboni WC, Kornblum ZA, Hu Z, Phipps R, Anders CK, Reeder-Hayes K, Carey LA, Weck KE, Perou CM, Dees EC A Phase I Trial of the PI3K Inhibitor Buparlisib Combined With Capecitabine in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Interim Results: Of the 25 patients enrolled, 23 were evaluable for DLT and 17 were evaluable for response. The maximum tolerated dose of the combination was buparlisib 100 mg daily and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily. DLTs included grade 3 hyperglycemia and grade 3 confusion. The most common grade 3 toxicities were diarrhea and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase. One patient exhibited a complete response to treatment and four had a confirmed partial response. In cohorts 3 and 4, in which the buparlisib dose remained constant but the capecitabine dose was increased, significant increases in the buparlisib plasma concentration were noted. Conclusion The combination of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer was generally well-tolerated, with several patients demonstrating prolonged responses. Unexpectedly low rates of PIK3CA mutations (3 of 17) were seen, and only 2 of 7 tumors with subtyping were luminal, making exploration of these putative predictive markers impossible. Further study of the combination is not unreasonable, with expanded pharmacokinetics and sequencing analysis to better elucidate potential drug-drug interactions and more accurate predictive biomarkers of response. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153866 http://www.clinical-breast-cancer.com/article/S1526-8209(17)30313-0/fulltext December 10, 2013 Presented at the 36th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, December 10-14, 2013, San Antonio, TX  Abstract Number: [P2-16-13] Dees EC, Marcom PK, Snavely A, Noe J, Anders CK, Blackwell K, Kimmick G, Reeder-Hayes K, Rosenstein D, Perou CM, Carey LA Phase I dose escalation clinical trial of the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and capecitabine (C) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) Interim Results:  21 patients (11 hormone receptor (HR)+, 3 HER2+, 9 HR/HER2-negative) were enrolled and treated. All were evaluable for toxicity and 14 for response to date. Median age was 54 (range 35-65). Median prior chemotherapy regimens for MBC was 2 (range 1-4). The following dose levels (DL) were evaluated: BKM120 50 mg/d + C 1000 mg/m2/BID x 14(DL 1-4 patients), BKM120 80 mg/d + C 1000 mg/m2/BID x 14 (DL2-3 patients), BKM120 100 mg/d + C 1000 mg/m2/BID x 14 (DL3-9 patients), BKM120 100 mg/d + C 1250 mg/m2/BID x 14 (DL4-5 patients). Most frequent adverse events (all grades) included: Nausea (12), mood disorders (11), PPE (9), diarrhea (8), fatigue (7), vomiting (5) mucositis (4), rash (4), photosensitivity (3), hyperglycemia (3). Grade 3 or higher AEs in any cycle were transaminitis (3) diarrhea (2) mood disorder (2), hyperglycemia, fatigue, photosensitivity, PPE (1 patient each). DLTs: grade 3 hyperglycemia (1/6 patients at DL3), and grade 3 mood disorder in 1/5 patients DL 4. Additionally 4 of 5 patients at DL 4 required dose reduction or delay prior to C3D1. Thus DL 4 exceeded the MTD and DL 3 was expanded for further safety evaluation. Antitumor activity was seen with best responses of 1 CR (at DL 3), 3 PR (DL1 and 4) and 7 SD. PK analysis, assessment of tumor PIK3CA mutation status and intrinsic subtype by PAM50 is ongoing. Conclusions:  The combination of BKM120 100 mg po q day and C 1000 mg/m2 / BID x 14 d in 21 day cycles is tolerable and appears active. PK and biomarker analysis are ongoing. A phase II trial is planned. http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs13/view.php?nu=SABCS13L_1573 ",

Janku; Biomarker analyses from a phase I study of WNT974, a first-in-class Porcupine inhibitor, in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. Interim Results:  At the data cut-off date, March 2, 2017, 94 pts were enrolled. Median age was 58.5 years (range, 28-77), 43% were male, and the most common cancer types were PC (30%), melanoma (26%), and breast cancer (21%). Patients received single-agent WNT974 orally at doses of 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 22.5, or 30 mg daily, 30 or 45 mg intermittently (4 days on, 3 days off), or 5 mg twice daily. Median duration of exposure was 4.9 weeks (range, 0.1-27.7). Safety, tolerability, and PK have previously been reported. AXIN2 expression in paired samples from skin and tumor showed evidence of Wnt pathway inhibition in all indications; this was not dose-dependent in the dose range studied. Immune signature analyses of a paired tumor sample subset (n = 8) revealed an inverse association between change in AXIN2 expression and change in chemokine and activated dendritic cell signatures. Conclusions:  Biomarker analyses show that WNT974 can potently inhibit Wnt pathway activity in skin and tumors. Immune signature data suggest that WNT974 treatment may promote T-cell recruitment into tumors, and support investigation of the combination of WNT974 with immunotherapy. The combination part of this study evaluating WNT974 combined with PDR001 (spartalizumab) is ongoing. http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4562/presentation/11151    March 9, 2016 Presented at the 117th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ASCPT), March 8-12, 2016,  San Diego, CA Abstract #: LB-001 Y. Ji, J. Morawiak, A. Mignault, S. Dolan, P. Huang, C. Mahajan, A. Myers Population PK/PD Modeling Of A First-In-Class Porcupine Inhibitor WNT974 In Advanced Cancer Patients To Support Dose Selection For Phase I Expansion Interim Results:  As of March 2, 2015 data cut-off, 66 patients were treated in the dose escalation at dose ranges and schedules of 5-30 mg QD; 30-45 mg QD 4 days on, 3 days off; and 5 mg BID. A 2-compartment model adequately described WNT974 PK. Exposure-response analysis of skin AXIN2 demonstrated that maintaining WNT974 Cmin,ss > 2.6 ng/mL would provide > 50% maximal inhibition with 95% probability. Logistic regression analysis for dysgeusia demonstrated that WNT974 Cmax,ss < 118 ng/mL and AUC24h,ss < 762 ng*h/mL would assure 50% probability of < 25% patients to have Grade 2 dysgeusia. PK simulation revealed that 10 mg QD maintains exposure within the desired window for the majority of patients. Conclusions:  This first population PK/PD modeling for the first-in-class Porcupine inhibitor WNT974 estimated the therapeutic window and guided dose selection for Phase I expansion. The approach can be applied to dose selection in early oncology development. https://guidebook.com/guide/54032/poi/5032526/?pcat=214285 Page 137 (139 of PDF) at: http://www.ascpt.org/Portals/8/docs/Meetings/2016%20Annual%20Meeting/Final%20Program.pdf November 5, 2015 Presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, November 5-9, 2015, Hynes Convention Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Abstract #: C45 Filip Janku, Roisin Connolly, Patricia LoRusso, Maya de Jonge, Ulka Vaishampayan, Jordi Rodon, Guillem Argilés, Andrea Myers, Shu-Fang Hsu Schmitz, Yan Ji, Margaret McLaughlin, Michael R. Palmer, Jennifer Morawiak Phase I study of WNT974, a first-in-class Porcupine inhibitor, in advanced solid tumors Interim Results:  As of data cut-off, March 2, 2015, 68 pts have enrolled. Sixty-six pts were treated in the dose escalation at dose ranges and schedules of 5-30 mg QD; 30-45 mg QD 4 days on, 3 days off; and 5 mg BID. WNT974 showed rapid absorption (median Tmax 1-3 h) and a mean elimination half-life of 5-8 h. Accumulation on Cycle 1 Day 15 was small (ratio <2). PK exposure was dose proportional and inter-patient variability was generally moderate. Reported AEs (>10%) suspected to be related to WNT974 included: dysgeusia (49%), decreased appetite (28%), nausea (27%), fatigue (19%), diarrhea (18%), vomiting (16%), hypercalcemia (13%), alopecia (10%), asthenia (10%), and hypomagnesemia (10%). Grade 3/4 related AEs (>2%) included: asthenia (4%), fatigue (4%), decreased appetite (3%), and enteritis (3%). Measurement of AXIN2, a ß-catenin target gene, in matched skin specimens, showed Wnt pathway inhibition at a wide range of doses. A recommended dose for expansion of 10 mg QD was chosen based on PK, PD, and tolerability data; maximum tolerated dose was not determined. There was no evidence of WNT974 antitumor activity in the dose escalation. As of data cut-off, two pts had initiated study treatment in the dose expansion and one, a pt with appendiceal cancer with an RNF43 mutation, had completed the first response assessment. This pt had stable disease with tumor shrinkage of -27%. Updated clinical data will be reported. Conclusion:  WNT974 is a first-in-class Porcupine inhibitor. Preliminary clinical data suggest WNT974 has a manageable safety profile and potential for antitumor activity in a molecularly selected population. Studies to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of WNT974 as a single agent and in combination are ongoing. http://www.abstractsonline.com/plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=3651&sKey=82338efd-dbea-4aff-885d-78d06bc47a7b&cKey=fc41cac4-0a70-41f2-ab95-b79e97492502&mKey=c69f0c7b-cff2-4010-ac6c-deae12e60491",

Smith, Barbara Eichhorst, Timothy Francis Cloughesy, Brett Garrick, Torsten Trowe, Ellen Filvaroff, Kristen Hege, Johanna C. Bendell Phase I trial of a dual TOR kinase and DNA-PK inhibitor (CC-115) in advanced solid and hematologic cancers. Interim Results: 44 subjects evaluated across 10 dose escalation cohorts (0.5 – 40 mg) established 10 mg twice-daily (BID) as the recommended dose for cohort expansion in 62 additional subjects with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM: 14), head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC: 18), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL: 8), and ETS-overexpressing tumors (castration-resistant prostate cancer [CRPC: 12] and Ewing’s sarcoma [ES: 10]). The most common (> 20%) expansion phase related adverse events were fatigue (37%), nausea (31%), decreased appetite (29%), and hyperglycemia (24%). Linear, dose proportional exposure was observed with a terminal half life of 4 to 8 hrs (mean steady state Cmax 75 ng/mL, AUC0-24 776 ngxhr/mL at 10mg BID). Gastric pH-altering drugs and food did not impact PK. Plasma accumulation was minimal, renal clearance was negligible and brain penetration was confirmed in resected GBM (tumor/plasma ratio 0.7). Inhibition of TORC1 (pS6, p4EBP1) and TORC2 (pAKT) biomarkers in blood cells was exposure-dependent and consistently achieved with 10 mg BID dosing. DNA-PK inhibition was demonstrated ex vivo in circulating CLL cells from one subject dosed with CC-115. Tumor responses during dose escalation included 1 complete response (endometrial; >3yr), 1 partial response (melanoma), and stable disease (SD) in 18 (41%) subjects. In the efficacy-evaluable expansion cohorts, SD was observed in CRPC (64%), HNSCC (53%), GBM (non-progression 21%), and ES (22%). One PR, and 3 PR with lymphocytosis (IWCLL), were seen in CLL. Conclusions: CC-115 was well tolerated with toxicities comparable with approved mTOR inhibitors. Evidence of TORC1/TORC2/DNA-PK pathway inhibition was observed as well as preliminary signals of broad anti-tumor activity. Phase 2 trials combining CC-115 with androgen deprivation in CRPC and radiation in GBM are planned. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/165591-176 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/15_suppl/2505",

      "TrialResults": "December 9, 2014 Presented at the 37th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, December 9-13, 2014, San Antonio, Texas, USA Abstract No: [P6-12-02] Isakoff SJ, Bendell JC, Cervantes A, Soria J-C, Molife LR, Sanabria-Bohorquez SM, Punnoose EA, Jia S, Patel P, Saura C Phase Ib dose-escalation study of an Akt inhibitor ipatasertib (Ipat) in combination with docetaxel (Doc) or paclitaxel (Pac) in patients (pts) with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) Interim Results:  As of 1 Apr 2014, 54 patients with multiple solid tumors, including 19 patients with MBC (TNBC: n=13, HER2-/HR+: n=4, and HER2-positive: n=2) were enrolled, and patients with MBC received Ipat with Doc (n=5) or Pac (n=14). The common Grade > or = 2 adverse events (AEs) related to Ipat in combination with Doc (> or = 10% and > 1 patient) were diarrhea (80%), nausea (60%) and vomiting (40%), versus in combination with Pac (> or = 10% of patients) were diarrhea (43%), fatigue (29%) and hyperglycemia (14%). The PKs of Ipat, Doc, or Pac were comparable to the single agents. Partial responses by RECIST v1.1 were seen in 5 patients, including patients with HER2-/HR+ (n=2) or TNBC (n=3) who had previously progressed on Pac (n=4) or PI3K inhibitors (n=2) or had tumors with PI3K/Akt alterations [PTEN loss (n=1), PIK3CA mut (n=2), or AKT1 mut (n=1)]. Time on study > 9 months occurred in 4 patients (HER2-/HR+ and TNBC) who had progressed on prior Pac (n=3) or PI3K inhibitors (n=3), and/or had tumors with PIK3CA mut (n=3). Conclusions:  Ipat in combination with Doc or Pac is well-tolerated and has a safety profile generally consistent with the single agent. Anti-tumor activity with Ipat in combination with taxanes was seen in MBC, including HER2-/HR+ or TNBC with baseline PI3K/Akt alterations. Updated safety, efficacy, and biomarker data will be presented. http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs14/view.php?nu=SABCS13L_1343 http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/75/9_Supplement/P6-12-02  September 26, 2014 Annals of Oncology 25 (supplement 4), September 2014 Presented at Madrid 2014 ESMO Congress, September 26 - 30 2014 Madrid, Spain Abstract No: 446PD  S.J.

Bendell  Phase Ib Dose-Escalation Study of the AKT  Inhibitor Ipatasertib (IPAT ) with Paclitaxel (P) in Patients (Pts) with Advanced Solid Tumors  Interim Results:  As of 1 April 2014, 27 patients with median age 58 (range 41-80), ECOG PS 0-1, enrolled at 400mg (n = 21) or 600mg (n = 6) and received median 3 cycles of Ipat (range 1-12). Grade >or= 2 adverse events (AEs) related to Ipat in >or= 10% of patients were diarrhea (44%), fatigue (22%), and hyperglycemia (11%). Grade 3 AEs related to Ipat occurred mostly at 600 mg (83%) vs 400 mg (14%), including diarrhea (n = 6), hyperglycemia (n = 3), dehydration (n = 2), anemia (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 1), and rash (n = 1). No dose-limiting toxicities occurred, but based on cumulative safety, the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is Ipat 400mg with P. There was comparable PK of Ipat and P to single agents. Partial responses by RECIST v1.1 were seen in 6 patients (22%), including HER2-neg or triple-neg BC (TNBC) patients who had progressed on P (n = 4) or PI3K inhibitors (n = 2) or had tumors with PI3K/Akt alterations [PTEN loss (n = 1) or PIK3CA mut (n = 2)]. Time on study > 6 months occurred in 5 patients, including HER2-neg BC with PIK3CA mut (n = 3).  Conclusions:  The RP2D of Ipat with P is 400mg, which is well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with the single agent. Anti-tumor activity was seen, including HER2-neg or TNBC with PI3K/Akt activation. Updated safety, efficacy, PK, and biomarker data will be presented.  Instructions for accessing abstracts:  1.

Bendell PI3K/AKT ACTIVATION AND RESPONSE IN PHASE IB: AKT INHIBITOR GDC-0068 WITH DOCETAXEL (D) OR MFOLFOX6 (F) IN REFRACTORY SOLID TUMORS Interim results: 61 patients enrolled: arm A (n = 27), arm B (n = 34); prior therapy in A: 96% (56% had taxanes), B: 91% (47% had 5-FU + platinum). PI3K/Akt was activated in 57% (n = 35): diagnostic-positive (Dx+) defined by PTEN-low (H-score < or = 200, n = 27), PIK3CA mut (n = 2), AKT1 mut (n = 1), or combined PIK3CA mut/ PTEN-low (n = 5). GDC-0068 was generally well-tolerated with D or F (no DLTs; grade 1-2 gastrointestinal toxicities); maximum administered dose was 600 mg QD with D or F. 6 patients had RECIST responses: n = 3 per arm (A: all had taxanes; B: 1 had FOLFOX, 2 had platinum); 4 were Dx + : PTEN-low (n = 1), AKT1 mut (n = 1), PIK3CA mut/PTEN-low (n = 2). 20 additional patients (A: n = 7, B: n = 13) had prolonged stable disease (> or = 120 days) and/or minor CT responses (> or = 20% but < 30%): PTEN-low (n = 11), PIK3CA mut (n = 2), PIK3CA mut/PTEN-low (n = 1), no mut (n = 2). PIK3CA mut suggested higher rate of response in both arms (71%, N = 7), followed by PTEN-low (47%, N = 32). KRAS mut did not predict resistance. Conclusions:  GDC-0068 600 mg QD combined well with D or F. PI3K/Akt activation occurred in more patients with RECIST responses and prolonged SD than progressive disease. Phase II trials will address activity in Dx+ patients.

Tabernero  Phase Ib Dose-Escalation Study Of The Akt Inhibitor Gdc-0068 With Docetaxel (D) Or Modified Folfox6 (F) In Patients (PTS) With Advanced Solid Tumors  Interim Results:  47 patients enrolled as of May 2012: Arm A (GDC-0068 in mg): 100 (n = 3), 200 (n = 4), 400 (n = 7), 600 (n = 10, with expansion), and Arm B: 100 (n = 6), 200 (n = 9), 400 (n = 6), 600 (n = 2, ongoing). Grade > or = 2 adverse events (AEs) related to GDC-0068 in > or = 10% of patients were nausea (17%), diarrhea (13%), fatigue (13%) in Arm A and nausea (17%) and diarrhea (13%) in Arm B. Fasting hyperglycemia due to GDC-0068 was only Grade 1 (<10%). All GDC-0068-related AEs were Grade 1-2, except Grade 3 diarrhea (n = 1), leukopenia (n = 1), hypophosphatemia (n = 2) in Arm A, and thrombocytopenia (n = 1), nausea (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1) in Arm B. No Grade = 4 AEs due to GDC-0068 or DLTs occurred up to GDC-0068 600 mg. Preliminary data show comparable PK of GDC-0068, 5FU, OX, and D to single agents. 6 patients had > or = 30% tumor reduction per RECIST, including patients with prior taxanes or 5FU/platinum, or with PI3K/Akt pathway alterations assessed by investigators, such as Akt1 mutant breast cancer (Arm A) and PTEN -loss colon cancer, PI3K mutant cervical cancer, and HER2+ esophageal cancer (Arm B).  Conclusions:  GDC-0068, combined with D or F, is safe and well tolerated up to 600 mg. Anti-tumor activity occurred, particularly in cancers with PI3K/Akt pathway alterations. Updated safety, efficacy, PK, and biomarker data, including expansion cohorts, will be presented.

Bendell A phase Ib study of the Akt inhibitor GDC-0068 with docetaxel (D) or mFOLFOX-6 (F) in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors.  Interim Results:   23 patients have enrolled; Arm A (GDC-0068, mg): 100 (n=3), 200 (n=4), and 400 (n=5); Arm B:100 (n=6) and 200 (n=5). Median prior therapies = 3. GDC-0068-related adverse events in > or = 10% of patients were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and decreased appetite. All GDC-0068-related AEs were grade 1 or 2, except one grade 4 neutropenia in Arm A. No DLTs have been reported to date. Preliminary data show no alteration in the PK of GDC-0068, D or F compared to phase Ia or historical data. Two heavily pretreated patients with cervical and PTEN-loss colon cancers treated in Arm B demonstrated both RECIST partial response and tumor marker decrease by first CT evaluation.  Conclusions:  The combination of GDC-0068 with D or F is well-tolerated and shows early signs of anti-tumor activity. Dose-escalations continue. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/100543-114 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/15_suppl/3021",

Clinical activity and safety of atezolizumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Interim Results: All 16 patients enrolled had received prior chemotherapy, and 50% prior bevacizumab. Ten patients (63%) experienced a treatment-related event. No treatment-related grade 4–5 events were reported. All deaths occurred due to progression or during follow-up. One patient experienced a partial response (5.3 months); 3 experienced disease stabilization. The median overall survival was 4.2 months (range 1.2 to 18.8+ months). Association between peripheral CD4+?T cells and efficacy was observed. Two patients with IDH1-mutant tumors and 1 with a POLE-mutant tumor experienced?=?16 months survival. Conclusions Atezolizumab was safe and well tolerated in this group of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Our preliminary findings suggest that biomarkers, including peripheral CD4+?T cells and hypermutated tumor status, may help guide selection of patients with recurrent glioblastoma who might receive most benefit from atezolizumab therapy, supporting further atezolizumab combination studies in glioblastoma. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30073642 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11060-018-2955-9 April 14, 2018  Presented at the 109th AACR Annual Meeting, April 14-18, 2018, Chicago, IL Abstract No.: 2616 / 17 Y. Li, C-W. Chang, M. Fasso, C. OHear, P. S. Hegde, L. Molinero; Baseline blood lymphocytes are associated with improved clinical outcome in atezolizumab-treated patients across multiple indications. Interim Results:  The prevalence of hematologic abnormalities across tumors was: lymphopenia (27-57%), followed by neutrophilia (2-24%), monocytosis (0-15%), eosinophilia (1-13%), eosinopenia (0-14%), basophilia (2-7%) and basopenia (0-6%). Neutrophilia, monocytosis, lymphopenia and low/high eosinophils were associated with worse PFS and OS, although with a different imprint depending on tumor ontogeny: neutrophilia was linked to reduced OS in melanoma and PFS for UBC, monocytosis was associated with lower OS in TNBC and UBC. Lymphopenia was associated with reduced PFS and OS in NSCLC, TNBC and reduced PFS in melanoma. NLR > = 5 was associated with reduced PFS in melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, UBC and reduced OS in UBC, NSCLC and TNBC. RLC > = 17.5% was linked to longer PFS in melanoma, RCC, UBC and to increased OS in TNBC, NSCLC and UBC. Lymphocyte subset analysis showed lymphopenia in B cells (40-61%), CD3 T cells (32-71%), CD4 T cells (28-66%), CD8 T cells (25-46%) and NK cells (16-23%). CD3 lymphopenia was associated to reduced OS in NSCLC, and CD4 lymphopenia was associated to reduced OS in NSCLC and TNBC. NK lymphopenia was associated to decreased OS and PFS in TNBC. Conclusions:  This is the first study showing that higher pretreatment relative lymphocyte counts is associated to improved clinical outcome in patients from different tumor etiologies treated with atezolizumab. The association of peripheral T cell counts to improved outcome in some indications suggests that the local antitumor response may be linked to pre-existing systemic T cells. http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4562/presentation/9580 February 8, 2018 J Clin Oncol 36, 2018 (suppl 6S; abstr 187) Presented at the ASCO 2018 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, February 8-10, 2018, San Francisco, CA Abstract #: 187 Joseph W.

Interim Results:  The 15 pts in the initial mCRPC cohort were evaluated (clinical cutoff: December 31, 2016). 13 pts (87%) had received > or = 2 prior lines of therapy for mCRPC. Median survival follow-up was 15.8 mo (range, 2.3-23.0). 9 pts (60%) had a treatment-related AE (TRAE); only 1 pt (7%) experienced a Gr 3 TRAE (hyponatremia). No Gr 4-5 TRAEs were reported. The landmark 12-mo OS rate was 55.6% (95% CI: 27.4, 83.7); median OS was not reached (range, 2.3-23.0 mo). Median PFS was 3.4 mo (95% CI: 2.3, 5.7); the 6-mo PFS rate was 26.7% (95% CI: 4.3, 49.1). 1 pt (9%) had a PR per irRC (irPR); 5 pts (45%) had SD per RECIST v1.1 and irRC. 2 pts (13%) had a > or = 50% decrease in PSA from baseline. The pt who experienced an irPR had increased CD8 expression and expansion of T-cell clones on study treatment.  Conclusions:  Atezo was well tolerated and demonstrated long-term disease control in pts with heavily pretreated mCRPC, with a 12-mo OS rate of 55.6%. Preliminary biomarker analyses from the pt who experienced an irPR were suggestive of an activated immune response. http://abstracts.asco.org/212/AbstView_212_205299.html February 8, 2018 JAMA Oncol. 2018 Feb 8. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.5440 Petrylak DP, Powles T, Bellmunt J, Braiteh F,, Loriot Y, Morales-Barrera R, Burris HA, Kim JW, Ding B, Kaiser C, Fassò M, O'Hear C, Vogelzang NJ, Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) Monotherapy for Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer: Long-term Outcomes From a Phase 1 Study. Interim Results: Ninety-five patients were evaluable (72 [76%] male; median age, 66 years [range, 36-89 years]). Forty-five (47%) received atezolizumab as third-line therapy or greater. Nine patients (9%) had a grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse event, mostly within the first treatment year; no serious related adverse events were observed thereafter. One patient (1%) discontinued treatment due to a related event. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Responses occurred in 26% (95% CI, 18%-36%) of patients. Median duration of response was 22.1 months (range, 2.8 to >41.0 months), and median progression-free survival was 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-4.3 months). Median overall survival was 10.1 months (95% CI, 7.3-17.0 months); 3-year OS rate was 27% (95% CI, 17%-36%). Response occurred in 40% (95% CI, 26%-55%; n?=?40) and 11% (95% CI, 4%-25%; n?=?44) of patients with programmed death ligand 1 expression of at least 5% tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC2/3) or less than 5% (IC0/1), respectively. Median overall survival in patients with IC2/3 and IC0/1 was 14.6 months (95% CI, 9.0 months to not estimable) and 7.6 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 13.9 months), respectively. Conclusion: Atezolizumab remained well tolerated and provided durable clinical benefit to a heavily pretreated metastatic urothelial carcinoma population in this long-term study. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423515 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2671610?redirect=true September 01, 2017 Annals of Oncology, Volume 28, Supplement 5, September 2017 Presented at the 2017 ESMO Congress, September 8-12, 2017, Madrid, Spain Abstract #: 1044O  R.

Median age was 62 y (range, 32-78 y), pts were heavily pre-treated (53% had > or = 2 prior lines of therapy) and 66% were current/previous tobacco users. Most common primary tumor sites were oropharynx (50%), oral cavity (22%) and nasopharynx (19%). Median treatment duration was 3.4?mo; 21/32 pts (66%) had a treatment-related AE. 3 pts (9%) had Gr 3 treatment-related AEs (tumor lysis syndrome, hyponatremia, pruritus, colitis). 1?pt (3%) had Gr 4 treatment-related cardiac tamponade. No Gr 5 treatment-related AEs were seen. In all pts (IC0/1, n?=?7; IC2/3, n?=?25), confirmed ORR was 22%, mPFS was 2.6?mo (range, 0.5-48.4?mo) and mOS was 6.0?mo (range, 0.5-51.6+ mo). Clinical activity by PD-L1 subgroups is shown in the Table. Preliminary analyses indicate that there was no association between HPV status and clinical outcomes. Conclusions: In advanced HNC, atezo was well tolerated. Encouraging response and long-term survival were seen independently of PD-L1 IHC or HPV status and warrant further investigation.

Braiteh Clinical activity, safety and biomarker results from a phase Ia study of atezolizumab (atezo) in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer (rEC). Interim Results:  As of March 31, 2016, 15 patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy (minimum follow-up, 11.2 mo). The median age was 61 y (range, 20-74 y), 53% were ECOG PS 1 and 93% had = 2 prior systemic therapies; 10 (67%) patients had prior RT. Patients were MSI-H (1/15), MSS (7/15) or MSI unknown (7/15). EC subtypes were endometrioid (5/15), serous (5/15), ER+ leiomyosarcoma (1/15) or unknown (4/15). Five (33%) patients were IC2/3, and 10 (67%) patients were IC0/1. Seven (47%) patients had any related AE, mainly G1-2 (5 patients). No G4-5 related AEs occurred. Two patients had related SAEs (colitis; rash). ORR was 13% (2/15) by RECIST. Both patients achieved PR and were IC2/3. ORR for IC2/3 patients was 40% (2/5). One responder was MSS and heavily infiltrated with TILs (IC3, 70% TILs, 1.8 Mut/Mb, unknown subtype); the other responder was hypermutated, MSI-H and moderately infiltrated with TILs (IC2, 10% TILs, 237 Mut/Mb, endometrioid). DOR in the 2 responders was 7.3 and 8.1+ mo. mPFS was 1.7 mo (range, 0.6-11+ mo); mOS was 9.6 mo (range, 0.6-11.8+ mo). Of the remaining patients, 2 had SD, 9 had PD and 2 were non-evaluable. DCR (PR + SD) was 27%. A trend for higher PFS and OS was seen in IC2/3 vs IC0/1 patients.  Conclusions:  Atezo had a favorable safety profile in rEC, with durable clinical benefit in some patients. Clinical benefit appeared to increase with higher PD-L1 expression, suggesting a link between PD-L1 status and response. Hypermutation and/or high immune infiltration may be linked to response to PD-L1 blockade, and further evaluation is merited. http://abstracts.asco.org/199/AbstView_199_187345.html http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/148914/abstract  February 16, 2017 J Clin Oncol 35, 2017 (suppl 6S; abstract 290) Presented at the ASCO 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, February 16-18, 2017, Orlando, FL Abstract No.: 290 Daniel Peter Petrylak, Thomas Powles, Joaquim Bellmunt, Fadi S.

Vogelzang;  Atezolizumab (atezo) in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC): A 2-year clinical update from a phase Ia study. Interim Results:  95 patients were safety evaluable . Median age was 66 years, 76% were male and 80% had primary bladder tumors. 61% had ECOG PS 1. 52% received > or = 3 prior systemic therapies for mUC (70% platinum). Median treatment duration was 3 months (range: 0-32 months); 24% were treated for > or = 1 year. Treatment-related AEs occurred in 66% (all Grade) and 8% (Grade 3-4) of patients. No treatment-related deaths were reported. In 94 objective response–evaluable patients (follow-up > or = 12 weeks), the ORR was 27% (95% CI: 18, 37%), and the CR rate was 10%; the SD rate was 19%. mDOR was 22.1 months (95% CI: 12.1, NE months) in all patients; 56% of responses (7/9 CRs and 7/16 PRs) were ongoing at the December 15, 2015 data cutoff. With a 24-month median follow-up duration (range: 1+ to 32 months), the 1-year OS rate was 47% (95% CI: 36, 58%), and the 2-year rate was 29% (19, 40%); mOS is in the Table. Updated clinical data with further follow-up and analyses by PD-L1 status will be presented. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with atezo was well tolerated, without new safety signals in heavily pre-treated mUC patients. The durability of responses, including CRs, along with extended OS, confirm atezo as a new standard for previously treated mUC patients.

Gettinger Clinical activity, safety and predictive biomarkers results from a phase Ia atezolizumab (atezo) trial in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) Interim Results: As of Dec 15, 2015, 17 pts with a minimum follow-up of 6.7 mo, were safety/efficacy evaluable. 65% were male; 88% were ECOG PS 1. Median age was 63 y (range 44-80), and pts were heavily pretreated (65%  > or =  3 prior therapies). 65% pts had all grade (1-5) treatment-related AEs most often fatigue (24%). There were 8 related G3-5 AEs in 3 pts, including 1 G3 pneumonitis leading to treatment discontinuation and 1 G5 hepatic failure. Confirmed ORR by RECIST was 6% (1 PR with DOR of 7 mo, also irPR by irRC) and 24% by irRC. 4/17 pts received atezo for  > or =  6 mo, 2 of these for  > or =  12 mo. 1 irPR pt stopped atezo per protocol after 1 y and remained in irPR for an additional 1 y until PD. Upon retreatment, the patient again derived benefit and is still on atezo as of data cutoff, 2.6 y from first dose. mPFS by RECIST was 1.5 mo (95% CI: 1.2, 2.7), and mOS was 5.9 mo (95% CI: 4.3, 20.1). PD-L1 expression was low overall, consistent with published data. A trend toward greater clinical benefit was seen for Teff gene signature and PD-L1 mRNA. Conclusions: These initial results in ES-SCLC demonstrate a tolerable safety profile with no new safety signals for atezo. Atezo also showed encouraging single-agent activity, based on the duration of clinical benefit in a subset of patients. Further studies of atezo in ES-SCLC are planned.

Gordon; Safety, Clinical Activity And Biomarkers Of Atezolizumab (Atezo) In Advanced Ovarian Cancer (OC) Interim Results As of Dec 15, 2015, 12 pts with ECOG PS 0/1 (50%/50%) and median age of 61 y (range 39-72) were evaluable for safety. 11/12 received > or = 2 lines of therapy. Atezo doses (mg/kg) were: 0.3 (n = 2), 10 (n = 1) and 15 (n = 9). With a median treatment duration of 2.8 mo, 11/12 pts had a treatment-related AE. These were mainly Gr 1-2; fatigue and pain were most common (5 pts each). 2 pts (17%) had a Gr 3 related AE (autoimmune hepatitis; maculopapular rash). There were no Gr 4 or 5 related AEs or AEs leading to withdrawal. Of 9 response-evaluable pts (10-15 mg/kg atezo and > or = 12 wk followup; 1 pt without RECIST measurable disease at baseline was evaluable for PFS/OS but not response), 2 pts (22%) had a PR. 1 responder had an 8.1 mo DOR and the other remains on study at 16.6+ mo with a 100% reduction in target lesion volume (1 nontarget lesion remained). 5 pts had PD and 2 were nonevaluable. Median PFS was 2.9 mo (95% CI 1.3-5.5). Median OS was 11.3 mo (95% CI 5.5-27.7) and 17.4 mo (95% CI 5.9-27.7) in 9 IC2/3 pts. Of the 10 evaluable for PFS/OS, 1 pt was IC0/1, 9 were IC2/3 and all belonged to an RNA-defined immunoreactive subgroup of OC that is associated with T cell activation and high PD-L1 expression. Atezo responders were IC2/3 and had low baseline CA125 levels vs pts who progressed. Conclusions: In this single-agent OC cohort, atezo demonstrated tolerable safety and encouraging clinical activity. Scientifically rational combinations with chemotherapy, targeted therapy or other cancer immunotherapies may augment the clinical benefit of atezo in OC pts.

Sequist, Colombe Chappey, Marcin Kowanetz, Alan Sandler, Jean-Charles Soria Clinical activity, safety and predictive biomarkers of the engineered antibody MPDL3280A (anti-PDL1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): update from a phase Ia study. Interim Results:  88 NSCLC patients were safety- and efficacy-evaluable: 57% of patients were male, 28% were ECOG PS 0 and 72% were ECOG PS 1. The median age was 61 y (range, 24-84 y), and the majority of patients had 3 lines of therapy. Patients received MPDL3280A for a median duration of 15 wks (range, 0-129 wks). Treatment-related all grade AEs occurred in 73% of patients, most often fatigue (21%), nausea (15%) and decreased appetite (14%). 11% of patients had a related G3-4 AE, most often dyspnea, hypoxia, fatigue and hyponatremia (2% each). One related G5 AE due to cardio-respiratory arrest was seen. ORRs, DOR, PFS and OS were assessed by PD-L1 status (Table). Of note, patients with PD-L1 expression of TC3 or IC3 (n = 20) had an ORR of 45% (95% CI, 23-68%) vs 14% (95% CI, 6-25%) for patients with PD-L1 expression of TC 0/1/2 and IC 0/1/2 (n = 58).  Conclusions:  PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment appeared to be a predictive biomarker for MPDL3280A clinical benefit with median OS not yet reached. Treatment with MPDL3280A was generally well tolerated.

Vogelzang; Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT A phase Ia study of MPDL3280A (anti-PDL1): Updated response and survival data in urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). Results:  Updated analyses include 85 efficacy-evaluable, selectively enrolled UBC pts; 46 were PD-L1 IHC 2/3, 38 were IHC 0/1 and 1 had unknown IHC status. Median age was 66 y (36-89 y), and 75% were male. Baseline visceral mets were present in 77% of pts; 98% received = 1 prior therapy (eg platinum in 93%). The ORR for IHC 2/3 pts was 46% (95% CI 31-61%; 6 CRs, 15 PRs), and for IHC 0/1 pts was 16% (95% CI 6-31%; 6 PRs) with median response durations not yet reached (IHC 2/3 pts, 0+ to 54+ wk; IHC 0/1 pts, 4+ to 33+ wk). Median PFS was 24 wk (95% CI 12-NE) for IHC 2/3 pts and 8 wk (95% CI 6-12 wk) for IHC 0/1 pts. 24-wk OS rates for IHC 2/3 and 0/1 pts were 85% (95% CI 74-96%) and 71% (95% CI 54-88%), respectively, with the medians not yet reached (3 to 72+ wk and 2+ to 51+ wk, respectively). Pts with visceral mets had ORRs of 32% (IHC 2/3: 3 CRs, 7 PRs; n = 31) and 12% (IHC 0/1: 4 PRs; n = 33). Median safety follow-up was 16 wk (3-73 wk). Drug-related AEs occurred in 64% of 87 safety-evaluable pts (most often fatigue, asthenia, nausea); 8% had a related G3-4 AE. 12% of pts had an immune-related AE. No related deaths were seen. Responders had lower myeloid gene expression at baseline (eg Cox-2, IL8; IL1B) and decreased circulating inflammatory and tumor markers (eg CRP; HCG, CA 19-9, CA-125) by cycle 2.  Conclusions:  MPDL3280A was well tolerated and had durable activity in UBC pts. Response, PFS and OS data are promising for IHC 2/3 and IHC 0/1 UBC pts vs historic controls. Response also correlated with in-tumor and blood-based biomarkers.  http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/148074-156 April 18, 2015 (Sub-group results)  Presented at the 106th AACR Annual Meeting, April 18-22, 2015,  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Abstract No: 2859  Leisha A.

Chen, Ian Krop  Inhibition of PD-L1 by MPDL3280A leads to clinical activity in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)   Results:  In the TNBC cohort, 27 patients were selectively enrolled. These patients had a median age of 48 y (29-82 y) and were evaluable for safety; 52% had ECOG PS 0 and 44% had ECOG PS 1. Visceral and bone metastases were present at baseline in 59% and 11% of patients, respectively. In addition, 85% received >or= 4 prior systemic regimens (neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic), including anthracyclines (78%), taxanes (82%) and platinum agents (15% cisplatin, 41% carboplatin). All-grade treatment-related AEs occurred in 67% of patients, most frequently fatigue (22%), pyrexia (15%), neutropenia (15%) and nausea (15%). 11% of patients experienced a Grade 3-5 related AE (5 Grade 3 events: adrenal insufficiency, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, decreased WBC count; 1 Grade 5 pulmonary hypertension event in a pt with an atrial septal defect). Among 21 efficacy-evaluable PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3 patients (13 IHC 2 and 8 IHC 3), the unconfirmed RECIST ORR was 24% (95% CI, 8% to 47%); 3 PRs and 2 CRs were observed. Response duration ranged from 0.1+ to 41.6+ wks, with the median not yet reached. patients with evidence of durable nonclassical responses suggestive of pseudoprogression were also observed. Overall, the 24-wk PFS rate was 33% (95% CI, 12% to 53%). Biomarker analysis revealed transient elevation of plasma cytokines and proliferating CD8 cells following MPDL3280A treatment. Updated clinical data, including PD-L1-negative patients, will be presented.  Conclusions: MPDL3280A was generally well tolerated and demonstrated promising efficacy in pretreated metastatic PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3 TNBC patients. Furthermore, circulating biomarker analyses revealed pharmacodynamic responses to MPDL3280A. Clinical evaluation of MPDL3280A in metastatic PD-L1 IHC 0 or 1 TNBC is ongoing.  http://www.abstractsonline.com/plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=3682&sKey=72104ef5-2237-46d6-a1a5-403333deb391&cKey=825060f4-471d-4fb2-af41-909dc246937b&mKey=19573a54-ae8f-4e00-9c23-bd6d62268424  December 9, 2014 (Subgroup Results) Presented at the 37th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, December 9-13, 2014, San Antonio, Texas, USA Abstract No: [PD1-6] Emens LA, Braiteh FS, Cassier P, DeLord J-P, Eder JP, Shen X, Xiao Y, Wang Y, Hegde PS, Chen DS, Krop I Inhibition of PD-L1 by MPDL3280A leads to clinical activity in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer Results:  Twelve patients were treated with MPDL3280A and evaluable for safety. Patients had ECOG PS 0-1 (33% ECOG PS 1), and the median age was 55 years (range, 29-72 years). All 4 patients (33%) with visceral metastases had liver metastases, and 1 patient (8%) had bone metastases. 92% of patients received > or = 2 prior therapies. Prior chemotherapies included anthracycline (92%), taxane (75%) and platinum (42%). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 8% of patients (1 event of Grade 3 adrenal insufficiency). One patient had an immune-related AE (Grade 2 pyrexia). No treatment-related deaths were observed. Nine patients were dosed by November 16, 2013 and evaluable for efficacy. The ORR was 33%, including 1 CR and 2 PRs. Responders included patients with visceral metastases at baseline. At the time of the clinical data cut-off, all responses occurred within 6 weeks of the first dosing of MPDL3280A, and all of the responses were ongoing. The median duration of response had not been reached. One patient achieved stable disease as best response. Two additional patients had tumor shrinkage (-43% and -44% change in target lesions, respectively) but were not counted as RECIST responders due to the appearance of new lesions, which is likely attributable to pseudoprogression. Preliminary pharmacodynamic biomarkers related to MPDL3280A activity, including circulating plasma markers and tumor immunomonitoring with CD8 IHC, will be presented along with updated clinical data. Conclusions:  MPDL3280A treatment was well tolerated and was associated with objective clinical activity in patients with pretreated metastatic TNBC. Further evaluation of the safety and clinical activity of MPDL3280A in both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative metastatic TNBC is ongoing http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs14/view.php?nu=SABCS13L_1389&terms= September 26, 2014 (Subgroup Results)    Annals of Oncology 25 (supplement 4), September 2014 Presented at Madrid 2014 ESMO Congress, September 26 - 30 2014 Madrid, Spain Abstract No: 808O J.

Loriot Inhibition of pd-l1 by mpdl3280a leads to clinical activity in patients with metastatic urothelial bladder cancer (ubc) Interim Results: As of Jan 1, 2014, 68 UBC patients were treated with MPDL3280A. 67 were evaluable for efficacy (dosed by Nov 20, 2013; with > or= 6 wk follow-up) and included 30 PD-L1 IHC 2/3, 35 PD-L1 IHC 0/1 and 2 PD-L1 unknown patients. The 67 efficacy evaluable patients were 72% male, had a median age of 65 y (36-86) and 59% were ECOG PS 1. 75% had visceral metastases and 33% had liver metastases. 72% received > or = 2 prior therapies, 93% received prior platinum-based chemo, 79% received prior cisplatin and 42% received MPDL3280A < or= 3 mo from last prior chemo. For IHC 2/3 pts, ORR was 43% (95% CI 26-63; 2 CRs, 11 PRs); the median duration of response (DOR) was not reached (range 0.1+ - 30.3+ wk). For IHC 0/1 patients, ORR was 11% (95% CI 4-26; 4 PRs); the median DOR was not reached (range 0.1+ - 6.0+ wk). 16/17 responders were still responding as of clinical cutoff date and included pts with poor prognostic factors. For the 17 responders, the median time to first response was 42 d (38-85 d). The 68 safety-evaluable patients received MPDL3280A for a median duration of 65 d (1-259 d). All grade study drug-related AEs occurred in 57% of patients, most often decreased appetite, fatigue and nausea. Treatment-related G3/4 AEs were seen in 4% of patients (no G4 AEs or treatment-related deaths were observed); there was 1 event each of asthenia, thrombocytopenia and decreased blood phosphorus. Treatment resulted in transient increases in pharmacodynamics biomarkers, including Ki-67 + CD8+ T cells and plasma proteins (eg, IL-18). Updated data will be presented, including PFS. Conclusions: MPDL3280A was well tolerated in this heavily pretreated UBC population. The majority of responses were rapid and on-going, and PD-L1 status correlated with response to MPDL3280A.

Powles Immune correlates and long term follow up of a phase Ia study of MPDL3280A, an engineered PD-L1 antibody, in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) Interim Results:  As of Jan 1, 2014, among 69 mRCC pts evaluable for safety, median age was 61 y and all were ECOG PS 0-1 (48% PS 1). 94% of patients had prior nephrectomy and 87% received prior systemic therapy, including cytokines (39%), VEGF-inhibition (64%) and mTOR inhibitors (26%). Patients received MPDL3280A for a median duration of 7.7 m (0.7-24.3 m). 80% of patients had a treatment-related AE; however, the frequency of G3 related events was 16%, including anemia, dehydration, fatigue and hypophosphatemia (3% each). No related G4 AEs or deaths occurred. Clinical activity was evaluated in 58 patients with clear cell histology dosed prior to Jul 1, 2013; 51 patients (88%) had an evaluable baseline PD-L1 IHC status. The ORR was 14% (8/58 PRs, 95% CI: 6, 25) and the median duration of response was 54 wks (2.7+ to 68.1+ wks). The 24-wk PFS rate was 53% (95% CI: 40, 66). An association was seen between PD-L1 intensity and response to MPDL3280A. Finally, antitumor activity that included immune-related responses was observed in non-clear cell histology patients (n = 10). Updated data including biomarkers will be presented. Conclusions:  MPDL3280A was well tolerated, with no treatment-related deaths. Evidence of increased activity was observed in patients with elevated PD-L1. Durable responses and prolonged SD were observed in mRCC patients, warranting further study. Instructions for accessing abstracts:  1.

Felip Biomarkers associated with clinical activity of PD-L1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (pts) in a phase I study of MPDL3280A Interim Results:  As of Apr 30, 2013, 53 NSCLC patients dosed by Oct 1, 2012, were evaluable for efficacy. In this trial ~30% of NSCLC pts were PD-L1 IHC 2 or 3. ORRs were associated with PD-L1 expression in ICs (p = .02): IHC 3: ORR 83% (5/6), IHC 2: 14% (1/7), IHC 1: 15% (2/13), IHC 0: 20% (4/20). PD-L1 expression in TCs did not significantly correlate with response (p = .92). The 24-wk PFS rate was 45%. Expression of checkpoint markers was a weaker predictor of MPDL3280A response and did not appear to confer MPDL3280A resistance in PD-L1 IHC2/3 patients (Table). Additionally, elevated IFN-gamma expression, and IFNgamma-inducible genes (e.g., IDO1 and CXCL9), did not appear to associate with MPDL3280A response. Refer source URL for tabular data  Conclusions:  These data suggest PD-L1 expression has a stronger correlation with ORR compared to other immune checkpoints. PD-L1 appears to be a leading predictive biomarker for response to MPDL3280A. These findings help provide a better understanding of biomarkers and MPDL3280A clinical activity.

Following exploratory analyses, two plasma biomarkers were chosen for further study and correlation with change in tumor size (the sum of the longest diameter) was assessed in a PKPD tumor modeling framework. When longitudinal kinetics of biomarkers and tumor size were modeled, tumor shrinkage was found to significantly correlate with AUC, baseline factors (metastatic sites, liver metastases, and smoking status), and relative change in interleukin 18 level from baseline at day 21 (RCFBIL-18,d21 ).   Conclusion:While AUC was a major predictor of tumor shrinkage, the effect was estimated to dissipate with an average half-life of 80 days, whereas RCFBIL-18,d21 appeared relevant to the duration of the response.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30058723 https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpt.1198 Last Update Posted : June 27, 2018 Actual Study Start Date : June 21, 2011 Estimated Primary Completion Date : September 30, 2018 Estimated Study Completion Date : September 30, 2018 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01375842 May 16, 2018 [Pooled Analysis] J Clin Oncol 36, 2018 (suppl; abstr 12000) Presented at the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting, June 1-5, 2018, Chicago, IL  Abstract Published online: May 16, 2018 Abstract No.: 12000 Fatema A.

Kadel, Marcin Kowanetz, Craig Cummings, Yan Li, David Fabrizio, Eric Peters, Priti S. Hegde, Lukas Amler, David S. Shames Association of high tissue TMB and atezolizumab efficacy across multiple tumor types. Results: tTMB was associated with efficacy across tumor types and lines of therapy. In the BEP, ORR was 16.4% (95% CI 14.2, 18.9), vs. 29.7% (95% CI 23.1, 37.1) in tTMB-H (> or =16 mut/Mb, N=175), and 13.5% (95% CI 11.3, 16.1) in tTMB-Low (<16 mut/Mb, N=812). DoR benefit was also observed: median DoR=29.0 mths (95% CI 18.6, NA) in tTMB-H vs. 16.6 mths (95% CI 13.8, 23.1) in BEP and 13.8 mths (95% CI 12.5, 17.4) in tTMB-Low cohorts. This association was not seen in control cohorts of randomized studies OAK, POPLAR, and IMvigor211. Pooled ORR in controls was 14.9% in BEP, 14.4% in tTMB-H and 15.1% in tTMB-Low. Survival analysis by tTMB is ongoing. tTMB-H also identified a population independent of PD-L1 status. tTMB by F1 was positively correlated with WES-based NAL in mUC (Pearson=0.85, N=218) and NSCLC (Pearson=0.78, N=70). NAL was associated with atezo ORR in mUC (p=2.7 x 10-9). Conclusions: High tTMB (> or = 16 mut/Mb) is associated with improved atezo response and DoR across NSCLC, mUC and melanoma and lines of therapy. tTMB-H by F1 may serve as a surrogate biomarker for NAL and may complement PD-L1 expression in providing predictive value. Ongoing studies are prospectively evaluating both tissue TMB and blood-based TMB for efficacy with CI.  https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/161442/abstract http://abstracts.asco.org/214/AbstView_214_220011.html  November 7, 2017 [Sub-analysis] Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer 2017, 5(Suppl 2):86, November 7, 2017. Presented at the 32nd Annual Meeting of Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, November 8-12, 2017, National Harbor, MD Abstract No. P68 Luciana Molinero, Yijin Li, Ching-Wei Chang, Sophia Maund, Maureen Berg, Jeanne Harrison, Marcella Fassò, Carol O’Hear, Priti S. Hegde, Leisha A. Emens; Immunogenomic evolution and atypical response to atezolizumab in a patient with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) Results: Tumor-immune microenvironment (TiME) biomarkers, including CD8, TILs and PD-L1, increased after capecitabine exposure, remaining high after GCI and XRT and through pseudoprogression on atezolizumab. At relapse post-atezolizumab, expression of TiME biomarkers decreased, particularly PD-L1. Immune-related RNA signatures (T and B cells, cytotoxicity and antigen presentation) confirmed these findings. Angiogenesis signature varied over time and was highest at early time points, lower postcapecitabine, higher before GCI, lowest at pseudoprogression and increased at relapse postatezolizumab. Proliferation signatures were highest in early tumors, decreasing over time. TNBC subtyping confirmed evolution of TiME from luminal androgen receptor (LAR) to basal-like immune suppressed (BLIS), then to basal-like immune active (BLIA) post-capecitabine and through pseudoprogression, with reversion to BLIS at relapse post-atezolizumab. Genomic profiling suggested possible driver mutations in RB1 and TP53. MYC amplification was lost over time, possibly associated with decay of the proliferation signature. The incidence of subclonal somatic mutations peaked post-XRT and were undetectable post-atezolizumab. Likewise, tumor mutational burden was highest post-XRT and lowest at pseudoprogression. Conclusions: This case report describes the evolution of tumor immunity and molecular subtypes with sequential therapies over time in a patient with TNBC and CR to atezolizumab. Immune, stromal and genomic biomarkers of TiME demonstrated temporal plasticity across multiple therapies, including atezolizumab. These findings suggest that TiME is pliable and may be strategically manipulated to maximize response to immunotherapy.

Results: Median tumor mutation burden (TMB) was 4.6 Mut/Mb (CI 95% 3.604 - 5.405). TMB was not associated with either TILs or immune biomarkers by IHC (PD-L1 or CD8) or with clinical activity (ORR, PFS or OS). The prevalence of loss of heterozygosity or mutations in TP53 or BRCA1/2 in this mTNBC cohort was 65%, 95%, and 10%, respectively. None of these genomic alterations were associated with clinical activity to atezo. RNA-Seq based analyses were performed in tissue from 96 patients. PAM50 profiling classified these tumors as 84% basal-like, 9% HER-2-enriched, 4% luminal A and 2% luminal B. TNBC subtyping (Burstein et al., CCR 2015) classified 42% of the tumors as basal-like (BL) immune activated (BLIA), 35% BL immune suppressed (BLIS), 17% luminal androgen receptor (LAR) and 2% mesenchymal (MES). Histopathology immune biomarkers TILs, PD-L1 and CD8 were highest in BLIA, intermediate in LAR and lowest in BLIS. ORRs by RECIST 1.1 were highest in BLIA and LAR, and lowest in BLIS and MES (17.5%, 18.8%, 0% and 0%, respectively). Although univariate analysis showed that the BLIA subgroup had significantly longer PFS and OS, multivariate analysis showed an association for both the BLIA and LAR subgroups with improved PFS and OS. High expression of pre-specified B- and T-cell RNA signatures were significantly associated with better ORR, PFS, and OS.  Conclusion: Comprehensive molecular characterization of tumors from this non-randomized phase 1 mTNBC cohort showed a low TMB. Mutations in BRCA1/2, TP53, or loss of heterozygosity did not impact atezo clinical activity. Clinical benefit from atezo was enriched in BLIA and LAR TNBC subtypes, both representing tumors with a rich tumor immune microenvironment.  http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs/view.php?nu=SABCS17L_1534 October 19, 2017 Roche YTD September 2017 sales Slide 78 Tecentriq (atezolizumab, RG7446) Anti-PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy – solid tumors Indication: Locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors Phase/study: Phase I # of patients: N=660 Design: Dose escalation study Primary endpoint: Safety and PK Status: FPI Q2 2011 Initial efficacy data presented at ASCO 2013 Data from bladder cohort presented at ASCO and ESMO 2014; TNBC cohort presented at AACR 2015; updated lung and bladder data presented at ASCO 2015; GBM data presented at SNO 2015; SCCHN data presented at ESMO 2017 CT Identifier NCT01375842 https://www.roche.com/dam/jcr:2b154838-34d9-4f35-9c49-336a96a94c91/en/irp3q17.pdf June 03, 2017 Roche presents new data for TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) and updates from across its cancer immunotherapy development programme at ASCO 2017 Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that new data for TECENTRIQ and updates from across its extensive cancer immunotherapy clinical development programme will be presented during the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting on 2 June – 6 June in Chicago, Illinois, United States... ...- Pipeline ...Monotherapy data will also be presented from a Phase Ia study of TECENTRIQ in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer (rEC), a patient population for whom the prognosis remains poor.

Despite a positive outcome for some patients with an aggressive form of breast cancer, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), treated with Roche's PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq, the study shows that questions about why some patients respond to treatment while others do not continue to challenge the immuno-oncology field. Roche claimed to be the first to report positive survival in patients with TNBC with data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Washington, D.C. April 3. The Phase I study showed patients treated with Tecentriq (atezolizumab) who responded to the treatment lived significantly longer compared to those who did not respond. The company presented Phase Ib data last year showing in the same patients showing positive overall response and objective response rates to treatment with Tecentriq in combination with Celgene Corp.’s chemotherapy Abraxane (paclitaxel-protein bound), but not survival data. Study leader Peter Schmid, director of St. Bartholomew’s Breast Centre at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and Barts Cancer Institute in London, said the most significant finding of the study was the difference in survival between responders and non-responders. All of the responders were alive after one year, while the one-year survival rate for non-responders was only 38%... ...The study presented at AACR enrolled 112 evaluable patients. Nineteen received Tecentriq as first-line treatment and 93 had received at least two or more therapies. Patients’ tumors were also evaluated for the presence of PD-L1 protein on the immune cells inside the tumor, a potential biomarker for efficacy, though physicians and drug makers are still trying to figure out how best to apply it to treatment. The study categorized patients in two cohorts by PD-L1 status: those with PD-L1 on fewer than 5% of immune cells and those with PD-L1 on 5% or more. There has been significant debate in the industry about how best to study patients by PD-L1 status in clinical trials. Per RECIST criteria, 11 patients responded to treatment, representing an overall response rate of 10% (including complete and partial responses). Of the 11 RECIST responders, five received Tecentriq as a first-line treatment and nine had disease with high PD-L1 expression. For responders, overall response rates were 100% at one year and two years, while overall survival rates for non-responders was 33% and 11% at one year and two years, respectively..

Lukas, M. Gandhi, C. O'Hear, S. Hu, C. Lai, J. Patel; Atezolizumab in Advanced NSCLC Patients with Baseline Brain Metastases: A Pooled Cohort Safety Analysis. Results:  27 (3%) of 843 patients in the pooled cohort had baseline brain metastases; 23 of whom were previously treated with radiation to the brain. Among the 27 patients, mean age was 60 years, 41% were male, 85% had non-squamous NSCLC, and 70% had received 3L+ therapy. Median number of atezolizumab cycles (21d/cycle) was 4 (range, 1-39). Neurological AEs occurred in 12 (44%) patients with and 229 (28%) patients without baseline brain metastases (Table). The incidence of treatment-related neurological AEs was 4 (15%) in patients with and 77 (9%) in patients without baseline brain metastases, including the most common treatment-related AE of headache in 2 (7%) and 27 (3%) patients, respectively. The most common all-cause AEs in patients with baseline brain metastases were fatigue, nausea, and vomiting (7 [26%] each); 3 (11%) patients developed new brain lesions on study, none during treatment. No treatment discontinuations occurred due to AEs. Conclusion:  The current analyses indicate that atezolizumab has an acceptable safety profile in patients with NSCLC who have asymptomatic or previously treated stable brain metastases. Further investigation is needed to fully assess the efficacy of atezolizumab in this patient population.

Gettinger, Xuchen Zhang, Robert Homer, Jennifer Possick, Anna Wurtz, Sarah B. Goldberg, Anne C. Chiang, Roy S. Herbst, Ami Rubinowitz Pneumonitis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with programmed death 1 (PD1) axis inhibitors. Results:  24 pts were identified with P, 21 with bronchoscopic sampling. 16 pts received anti-PD1, 2 anti-PDL1, 1 anti-PDL1 + chemotherapy, and 5 anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 + anti-CTLA4 Ab; objective response rate (RECIST) was 50%. Median age, 75 years (range, 47-89); female/ male, 9/ 15; squamous/ non-squamous histology, 6/ 18; never smoker/ smoker, 3/ 21. All pts were Caucasian. Median onset of P was 75 days (range, 8-549). 19 pts were treated with steroids; P resolved to grade 1 or 0 in all cases. 6 pts were re-challenged with anti- PD1/ PDL1 after steroid taper, 4 developed recurrent P. Three distinct radiographic patterns of P were appreciated: Type 1, organizing pneumonia (consolidation +/- ground glass opacity with a peripheral/ peribronchovascular distribution); Type 2, ground glass opacity (diffuse or focal ground glass opacities); Type 3, nodular (perilymphatic or centrilobular nodules). 52/ 28/ 8% of pts had pure Type 1/ 2/ 3 (1 pt had different pattern with recurrent P). 12% had mixed patterns (2 with Type 1 + 2; 1 with Type 1 + 3). 22 cases involved more than 1 lobe of the lung. 3 pts had primarily peri-tumoral opacities. Transbronchial biopsies were available on 20 pts: all had varying degrees of lymphocytic infiltrate (mainly T cells), 7 had granulomas, 8 had eosinophils (including 2 with granuloma). CD4/ CD8 staining was available in 19 cases, with predominance of CD8+ cells; mean CD4/CD8 ratio, 0.46.  Conclusions:  P is a rare but treatable complication of PD1 axis inhibitor therapy, with distinct radiographic patterns (organizing pneumonia, ground glass opacity and nodular) and pathological features (granulomatous vs non-granulomatous inflammation). Additional ongoing characterization of immune infiltrate may help to elucidate mechanisms of P with PD1 axis inhibitors. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/165443-176 http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/15_suppl/9030 May 18, 2016 (Pooled analysis) J Clin Oncol 34, 2016 (suppl; abstr 11506) Presented at the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting, June 3-7, 2016, Chicago, IL Abstract No: 11506 Peter Schmid, Priti S.

Stephen Hodi  Association of PD-L2 expression in human tumors with atezolizumab activity.  Results:  A close Spearman correlation was observed for PD-L1 and PD-L2 transcripts in melanoma (0.8), UC (0.77), NSCLC (0.74) but less so in RCC (0.43). Overall survival HRs and odds ratios (ORs) of being a responder using the median expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 across 4 cancer types are listed (Table). High expression of either ligand in these tumors was associated with improved OS benefit to atezo treatment. Neither ligand had an association with OS benefit of docetaxel (doc) in NSCLC patients. OS HR of PD-L2 high in the randomized trial (POPLAR) of atezo vs doc was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31-0.83), favoring atezo. Conclusions:  Clinical outcomes in 4 distinct cancer types showed that high expression of PD-L2 was associated with improved benefit of atezo therapy.These data show that blocking the PD-L1:PD-1 and PD-L2:B7.1 axes but not PD-L2: PD-1 axis is highly efficacious in PD-L2 high patients. Further evidence is required to understand the role of PD-L2 in cancer.

Sixty-three patients with ccRCC were evaluable for overall survival (median, 28.9 months; 95% CI, 20.0 months to not reached) and progression-free survival (median, 5.6 months; 95% CI, 3.9 to 8.2 months), and 62 patients were evaluable for objective response rate (ORR; 15%; 95% CI, 7% to 26%). ORR was evaluated on the basis of PD-L1 IC expression (IC1/2/3: n = 33; 18%; 95% CI, 7% to 35%; and IC0: n = 22; 9%; 95% CI, 1% to 29%). The ORR for patients with Fuhrman grade 4 and/or sarcomatoid histology was 22% (n = 18; 95% CI, 6% to 48%). Decreases in circulating plasma markers and acute-phase proteins and an increased baseline effector T-cell-to-regulatory T-cell gene expression ratio correlated with response to atezolizumab. Conclusion: Atezolizumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile and promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic RCC. Correlative studies identified potential predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

Wong, Kevin Becker, Marcella Fasso, Colombe Chappey, Carlos Bais, Carol O'Hear, Joachim Baehring  Clinical activity and safety of atezolizumab (anti-PDL1) in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) This study involved an expansion cohort of patients with GBM who were enrolled in a multi-center, multi-arm adaptive Phase Ia study of atezo for advanced tumors. The primary objective was to evaluate single-agent toxicity and tolerability. The secondary objective was to assess atezo anti-tumor activity. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed GBM in first or second relapse, Karnofsky performance status = 70, prior treatment with radiation and/or temozolomide and surgical resection = 4 weeks prior. Patients on a low dose of dexamethasone (= 4 mg per day) were allowed. Patients received atezo 1200 mg IV q3w until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Responses were assessed at least every 6 weeks on index and non-index lesions using RANO criteria. PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells in tumor biopsies was centrally evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the SP142 assay. Safety, clinical activity and biomarker data will be reported for a projected 14 treated patients (Aug 7, 2015, data cutoff). https://soc-neuro-onc.conference-services.net/reports/template/onetextabstract.xml?xsl=template/onetextabstract.xsl&conferenceID=4558&abstractID=930468  November 4, 2015 (Sub-Analysis) Presented at 30th Annual Meeting and Associated Programs of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC 2015), National Harbor, MD, USA. 4-8 November 2015 Abstract No: P83 Thomas Powles1*, Dorothee Nickles2, Eliezer Van Allen3, Colombe Chappey2, Wei Zou2, Marcin Kowanetz2, Edward Kadel2, Mitchell Denker2, Zachary Boyd2, Nicholas Vogelzang4, Joseph Kim5, Joaquim Bellmunt3, Yohann Loriot6, Charles G Drake7, Carol O'Hear2, Marcella Fasso2, Priti Hegde2 and Sanjeev Mariathasan2\t Immune biomarkers associated with clinical benefit from atezolizumab (MPDL3280a; anti-PD-L1) in advanced urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) Results: Baseline gene expression in tumors revealed an effector T cell signature (including CD8A, GZMA, IFNG) and NK gene signature (NKG2 family members) associated with clinical benefit. In contrast, disease progression was associated with either a concomitant presence of the immune signature and an opposing stromal signature (PDPN, COL5A1, etc) or the absence of both signatures. Expression of T cell effector and immune checkpoint genes (CTLA4, PD-1, TIGIT, LAG3) correlated with PD-L1 expression on IC but not TC. Increased expression of myeloid-derived cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in the plasma was associated with lack of clinical benefit. Moreover, on-treatment sampling revealed an increased plasma HCG, CA15-3 and TIMP-1 to be correlated with disease progression. Immune biomarkers associated with PBMC, as well as tumor biomarkers associated with various tumor subtypes, will also be discussed. Conclusions:Our findings indicate that clinical benefit (as defined by 6-month PFS) from atezolizumab is influenced by a pre-existing CD8+ effector T cell and NK cytolytic gene signature in the tumor, which correlated with IC PD-L1 expression. Increased stromal and myeloid-derived cytokine expression in tumor and plasma, respectively, were associated with lack of clinical benefit, underscoring the complex interplay among immunological components in UBC. These components may be conceivable targets to overcome potential resistance and promote response to atezolizumab.  http://www.immunotherapyofcancer.org/content/3/S2/P83 October 22, 2015 3rd Quarter 2015 Conference Call  Slide 86 Atezolizumab (PD-L1 MAb, MPDL3280A, RG7446) Novel approach in cancer immunotherapy Indication: Locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors Phase/study: Phase I # of patients: N=689 Design:Dose escalation study Primary endpoint: Safety/PK Status: FPI Q2 2011 Initial efficacy data presented at ASCO 2013 Updated data presented at ECC 2013 Data from bladder cohort presented at ASCO and ESMO 2014 Data from TNBC cohort presented at AACR 2015 Updated lung and bladder data presented at ASCO 2015 GBM data to be presented at SNO 2015 http://www.roche.com/irp3q15e.pdf October 22, 2015 Compound/Generic name : RG7446  Indication : solid tumors  Phase: I  Description/Summary:  Tumor immunotherapy is the use of the immune system to reject cancer.

Patients were frequently heavily pre-treated, with a median of 3 (0-7) prior therapies. Any grade treatment-related AEs occurred in 71% of patients, including fatigue (30%), infusion-related reaction (26%), nausea (19%), chills (17%) and vomiting (13%). Grade 3/4 drug related AEs were noted in 6% of patients. No drug-related AEs led to study drug discontinuation. MGA271 showed linear PK. As of 30 July 2015, 20 of 46 patients treated under the new study design continue on study drug. Patients experienced disease stabilization (>12 weeks) and tumor shrinkage (2-69%) across several tumor types. The study continues to enroll patients and generate more mature data. Conclusions MGA271 has a favorable safety profile and initial evidence of anti-tumor activity across several tumor types. These data support continued evaluation of MGA271 monotherapy and in combination with other immune modulators, including checkpoint inhibitors. http://www.immunotherapyofcancer.org/content/3/S2/O8 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4645418/",

Additional study objectives are to define the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and potential anti-tumor activity of enoblituzumab in patients with refractory cancer that expresses B7-H3. In the dose-escalation segment of the enoblituzumab Phase 1 study, 26 patients with 15 different types of B7-H3-positive tumors were treated with increasing weekly doses ranging from 0.01 mg/kg up to 15 mg/kg. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed at doses up to 15 mg/kg, and this dose has now been used for treatment of patients in the subsequent expansion cohorts. The initial expansion cohorts (15 patients each), included patients with melanoma, prostate cancer, and a group of patients with any other B7-H3-positive tumor. Enrollment of these cohorts was completed in 2015. In late 2014, we initiated additional dose expansion cohorts (16 patients each) using enoblituzumab as monotherapy in patients with melanoma (who have progressed despite prior checkpoint inhibitor treatment), renal cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and a cohort of patients with lung or bladder carcinoma that have particularly intense expression of B7-H3. We also modified the study to dose intensify the schedule of enoblituzumab administration, and to deploy patient management and tumor assessment approaches based on “immune-related” response criteria. Data from the ongoing Phase 1 study (as of September 21, 2015) were presented in a late-breaking abstract presentation at the 2015 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting. Enoblituzumab was shown to be well tolerated at all dose levels tested in the Phase 1 study (up to 15 mg/kg), with Grade 3/Grade 4 drug-related adverse events (AEs) in only 4% of patients, no severe immune-related adverse events, and no drug-related treatment discontinuations. The most common AEs have been infusion-related reactions and fatigue. Mild-moderate infusion reactions have been readily managed with conventional supportive care, including administration of corticosteroids and a decreased infusion rate. In this Phase 1 study of enoblituzumab, initial monotherapy anti-tumor activity was observed across several tumor types, including patients with prostate and bladder cancer as well as melanoma. Overall, this patient population had been heavily pre-treated (median number of prior therapies = 3), and in the patients with melanoma, all had been treated previously with one or more checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 antibodies). In addition to the presentation of initial safety and activity data, findings were presented showing that increases in T-cell repertoire (TCR) clonality in the peripheral blood of tumor patients following treatment with enoblituzumab, demonstrating that enoblituzumab can modulate T cells in these patients. Collectively, these findings support the ongoing evaluation of enoblituzumab as monotherapy and in combination with other immuno-oncology agents, including pembrolizumab and ipilimumab.

B7-H3 is widely expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the immune response to various types of cancer. There are no currently approved therapeutic agents directed against B7-H3. We have two clinical product candidates directed against B7-H3, enoblituzumab and MGD009, and we also have ongoing research efforts underway to advance an antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, directed against B7-H3. Our most advanced candidate in this franchise, enoblituzumab, is a monoclonal antibody that has also been enhanced using our Fc Optimization platform. Enoblituzumab is being evaluated clinically in three studies – as monotherapy, in combination with pembrolizumab and in combination with ipilimumab, another immune system checkpoint inhibitor – in each case, across multiple tumor types. Our Product Candidates Program(Target): Enoblituzumab(B7-H3) Indication: Solid Tumors(mono.) Phase I Our Commercial Right: Worldwide ...Enoblituzumab (which we also refer to as MGA271) is an antibody that targets B7-H3. We engineered enoblituzumab to utilize the same Fc Optimization enhancements that we incorporated in margetuximab to target B7-H3 that is over-expressed on differentiated tumor cells, cancer stem cells and supporting tumor vasculature and underlying tissues. We are currently evaluating enoblituzumab in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial as monotherapy in multiple dose expansion cohorts, including patients with melanoma (who have failed prior therapy with checkpoint inhibitors), renal cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and a cohort of patients with lung or bladder carcinoma that have particularly intense expression of B7-H3. In 2015, we also initiated two Phase 1 clinical trials, one combining enoblituzumab with ipilimumab and a second combining enoblituzumab with pembrolizumab. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1125345/000112534516000046/form10k.htm December 9, 2015 Excerpted from: MacroGenics Presentation at the Oppenheimer 26th Annual Healthcare Conference Our Pipeline of Product Candidates Eight clinical-stage programs with = 1 new INDs annually ONCOLOGY Program (Target): Enoblituzumab (B7-H3) Indication: Solid Tumors (mono.)

Dr. John Powderly II of the Carolina BioOncology Institute, Huntersville, NC, presented \"Interim Results of an Ongoing Phase 1, Dose Escalation Study of MGA271 (Fc-optimized Humanized Anti-B7-H3 Monoclonal Antibody) in Patients with Refractory B7-H3-Expressing Neoplasms or Neoplasms Whose Vasculature Expresses B7-H3.\" This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety of enoblituzumab in patients with advanced cancer that expresses B7-H3 in the tumor and/or tumor-associated vasculature.  Additional study objectives are to define the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and potential anti-tumor activity of enoblituzumab in patients with refractory cancer that expresses B7-H3. Enoblituzumab has been well tolerated at all dose levels tested in the Phase 1 study (up to 15 mg/kg), with Grade 3/Grade 4 drug-related adverse events (AEs) in only 4% of patients, no severe immune-related adverse events, and no drug-related treatment discontinuations. The most common AEs have been infusion-related reactions and fatigue. Mild-moderate infusion reactions have been readily managed with conventional supportive care, including administration of corticosteroids and a decreased infusion rate.  In this ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation study of enoblituzumab, monotherapy anti-tumor activity was observed across several tumor types, including patients with prostate and bladder cancer as well as melanoma. Overall, this patient population had been heavily pre-treated (median number of prior therapies = 3), and in the patients with melanoma, all had been treated previously with one or more checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 antibodies)... http://ir.macrogenics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=941374 November 4, 2015 Excerpted from: MacroGenics Provides Update on Corporate Progress and Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results ...ROCKVILLE, Md., Nov. 04, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MacroGenics, Inc...today provided a corporate progress update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015... ...Pipeline Update ...7-H3 Franchise - MacroGenics is developing a portfolio of therapeutics that target B7-H3, a member of the B7 family of molecules involved in immune regulation.

Larson, Christina Pressl, Mark Dunphy Phase I trial of the HSP-90 inhibitor PU-H71. Interim Results:  To date, 40 patients have received PU at doses from 10-400mg/m2. 37 are currently evaluable for DLT, and the last 3 patients needed (per CRM) are being enrolled. Five patients experienced DLTs: 1 (of 2) at 400 mg/m2 - grade 3 mucositis; 4 (of 7) at 350 mg/m2– 1 pt grade 3 AST and ALT, 1 patient grade 3 nausea/vomiting + grade 2 intolerable myalgia, 1 patient grade 3 anemia, 1 patient grade 2 intolerable headache. Related grade 3 toxicities seen in more than one patient include: AST (n = 2), atrial fibrillation (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 2), hypertension (n = 2), hyponatremia (n = 3), lymphopenia (n = 6) and WBC decrease (n = 2). Grade 4 toxicities include lymphopenia (n = 2), amylase (n = 1), and urine output decrease (n = 1). Intratumoral concentrations of 0.5 – 8 µM (greater than the IC50 for most cancer cells) were consistently achieved 24h after first dose at doses of 50 - 300 mg/m2, suggesting that target saturation may be achieved below DLT-related doses. Tumor regressions included: 22.6% in a cervical SCC patient (140 mg/m2), 8.3% in a triple negative breast cancer patient (300 mg/m2), 25.6% in an ER positive breast cancer patient (400 mg/m2), 20.8% in a penile SCC (350 mg/m2) pt and 20.6% in a Marginal Zone Lymphoma pt (50 mg/m2). One MPN patient decreased WBC and increased hemoglobin > 1 unit. 23 patients had *PU PET imaging. 13 of these had CNBs. Intratumoral concentrations measured both ways were in close concordance.  Conclusions:  PU is a well tolerated HSP-90 inhibitor with signals of activity seen in several tumor types.*PU can be used to visualize PU uptake and *PU PET scans can be used to estimate intratumoral concentrations of PU.  http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/146067-156 May 16, 2013 J Clin Oncol 31, 2013 (suppl; abstr 11076) Presented at: American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO 2013 Abstract No: 11076 John F.

Jhaveri, Brian Krichevsky, Mei Hsuan Chen, Payal Dixit, Mark Dunphy  Using 124I-PU-H71 PET imaging to predict intratumoral concentration in patients on a phase I trial of PU-H71.  Interim Results:  To date, 13 patients have received PU-H71 on the phase I trial. Of these, 10 have undergone *PU-H71 PET imaging. 4 imaged patients also volunteered for CNBs, with results reported in the table. Of the 10 patients who underwent *PU-H71 imaging in the phase 1 study, 5 also underwent prior *PU-H71 imaging in the microdose pilot. Intratumoral concentrations as calculated in the pilot and phase I studies were in close concordance.  Conclusions:  *PU-H71 can be used to visualize PU-H71 uptake in a variety of solid tumors and lymphoma, and *PU-H71 PET scans can be used to estimate intratumoral concentrations of PU-H71. Direct intratumoral measurements of PU-H71 correlate reasonably closely with concentrations calculated from *PU-H71 PET imaging. Further refinement of this imaging tool will allow quantitative assessment of PU-H71 uptake in tumors during the ongoing phase I trial.   http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/110662-132  http://meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/15_suppl/11076",

As a result of this transaction, GSK has acquired Novartis’s global Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) for an initial cash consideration of $5.25 billion; has created a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare joint venture with Novartis in which GSK will have majority control and an equity interest of 63.5%; and has divested its Oncology business for an aggregate cash consideration of $16 billion. The net after tax proceeds of the transaction received by GSK today are estimated to be $7.8 billion. This reflects the full consideration of $16 billion paid today by Novartis for GSK’s Oncology portfolio and related assets. Under the terms of the transaction, up to $1.5 billion of that purchase price may have to be returned to Novartis if certain conditions relating to the COMBI-d Trial are not met. Following the positive results from this study announced on 6 February 2015, GSK believes these conditions will be satisfied. As a result, following today’s completion, GSK plans to use the transaction proceeds to fund the full amount of the previously announced capital return of £4 billion to shareholders. Subject to shareholder approval, the capital return is expected to be implemented through a B share scheme, which will provide capital treatment for all UK tax-resident shareholders. Further details on the capital return will be sent to shareholders in due course... http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2015/gsk-completes-major-three-part-transaction-with-novartis/ March 02, 2015 Novartis announces completion of transactions with GSK - Completes transactions with GSK including: acquisition of GSK oncology portfolio, creation of Consumer Healthcare joint venture, and sale of non-influenza Vaccines business ...- Addition of GSK oncology products and two pipeline compounds is expected to expand Novartis position in targeted therapies and small molecules, positioning Novartis as a preferred partner for combination agents - Transactions expected to immediately lift core margins and further support overall financial strength Basel, March 2, 2015 - Novartis announced today that it has completed a series of transactions with GlaxoSmithKline plc, including the acquisition of certain oncology products and pipeline compounds from GSK, the creation of a world-leading consumer healthcare business through a joint venture that combines the two companies' consumer divisions, and the divestiture of the Novartis non-influenza Vaccines business to GSK.

Experimental: CC-122 MM-2 A new MM cohort (MM-2) will be enrolled in order to evaluate tolerability, safety and preliminary efficacy of the CC-122 formulated capsule given on an intermittent schedule (5/7 days per week) in 2 parallel dose escalation cohorts (MM-2a and MM-2b, respectively) (DEX) in Pomalidomide naïve subjects Assigned Interventions Drug: CC-122 CC-122 dose in both arms will increase by 1 mg increments starting with 3 mg 5/7 days using the 3+3 design in dose escalation phase. A dose-level -1, with a starting dose of 2mg, may also be evaluated if the opening dose level is not tolerated. At all dose levels in MM-2b arm, DEX will be combined with CC-122 at a starting dose dependent on the subject's age: for subjects who are = 75 years of age, DEX 40 mg/day will be given on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle and for subjects who are > 75 years of age, DEX 20 mg/day will be given on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Approximately 33 subjects will be enrolled in the dose escalation phase (15 in each treatment arm). An additional intermittent schedule of 21/28 days may be evaluated per Safety Review Committee (SRC) decision. Following dose escalation, one or two arms will be expanded at or below the MTD in up to 28 subjects (14 subjects in each arm). Experimental: CC-122- DLBCL-2 A new DLBCL cohort (DLBCL-2) in order to evaluate intermittent schedules of CC-122 (5 continuous days out of 7 days per week [5/7 days] and/or 21 continuous days out of 28 days per cycle [21/28 days]). Doses to be explored include 4 mg and 5 mg on an intermittent schedule using the 3+3 design described in Part A in order to establish an MTD for the intermittent dosing schedules. Following dose escalation, one or more intermittent dosing schedules may be expanded at or below the new intermittent schedule MTD in at least 20 total subjects per dosing schedule. Assigned Interventions Drug: CC-122 One or more intermittent schedules of CC-122 either given 5 continuous days out of 7 per week (5/7 days) or 21 continuous days out of 28 days per cycle (21/28 days). Following dose escalation, one or more of these intermittent schedules will be evaluated at a starting dose of 4 mg. Experimental: CC-122- GBM-2 A new GBM cohort (GBM-2) in order to evaluate doses of CC-122 above the 3 mg QD MTD determined in all comers in Part A. CC-122 dose will increase in 1 mg increments starting with 4 mg daily on a continuous schedule using the 3+3 design described in Part A in order to establish an MTD specific for GBM subjects. Following dose escalation, the cohort will be expanded at or below the new MTD in up to 20 total subjects. Assigned Interventions Drug: CC-122 Dose escalation on a continous schedule will be evaluated at a starting dose of 4 mg. Specifically, dose levels with 1 mg increments (eg 4mg, 5mg, 6mg etc.) will be evaluated using a 3+3 design as detailed in Part A of the protocol . Experimental: Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) During dose expansion of selected intermittent schedules, an additional cohort of up to 10 subjects with PCNSL will also be explored at the same dose and schedule as DLBCL to confirm some safety and preliminary efficacy signal Assigned Interventions Drug: CC-122 Up to 10 subjects with relapsed or refractory PCNSL will be enrolled to a PCNSL cohort to evaluate intermittent schedules of CC-122 and to further explore preliminary signals of efficacy and biomarker hypotheses.

Interim Results:  As of May 1, 2017, 97 R/R DLBCL subjects from 18 institutions were enrolled/treated; 81 were enrolled at doses/schedules selected for expansion (3 mg QD AIC n=24, 4 mg 5/7 AIC n=39, and 3 mg F6 5/7 n=18), and 16 were enrolled at other dose levels. Eight subjects were ongoing as of the data cutoff date. Twelve subjects had transformed lymphoma (12.4%) and 85 DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS) (87.6%). The median age was 62 (36% were >65) and 57% were male, 98% had ECOG 0-1 at screening, 62% were refractory to their last prior therapy (SD/PD), 30% had CR to prior R-CHOP, and 44% had <CR to prior R-CHOP. Median prior lines was 3 (range 1-13), 86% were treated with =2 prior lines of therapy. Of the 57 R/R DLBCL subjects enrolled in the 5/7 schedule at doses chosen for expansion, a total of 46 subjects (81%) experienced =1 Grade 3-4 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), of which 34 (60%) was suspected to be related to CC-122, and serious adverse events (SAE) suspected to be related to CC-122 were reported in 25% of subjects. The most common grade 3-4 TEAEs were neutropenia (39%) and infections (combined term, 17.5%). There was 1 grade 5 event of pneumonia suspected to be related to CC-122. Dose reduction due to AEs (most commonly due to neutropenia) occurred in 12 subjects (21.1%); 40.4% of subjects received at least one dose of G-CSF. Fifty-one subjects (89%) had discontinued treatment as of the data cutoff; the most common reasons for study discontinuation were disease progression (60%), adverse event (16%), death (5%), and candidate for transplant (4%). Pooled efficacy is shown for DLBCL NOS subjects with at least 2 prior lines of therapy treated at doses/schedules of CC-122 selected for expansion. As observed in Table 1, gene classifier positive patients had a better outcome than gene classifier negative patients Conclusions:  CC-122 appears well tolerated with encouraging activity in patients with R/R DLBCL. CC-122 has broad activity across cell of origin including in ABC, GCB, and unclassified subsets. Preliminary efficacy data demonstrated differential effects of CC-122 between gene classifier positive and negative subjects. A novel gene expression signature is being established to enrich for responders to CC-122. The observed signals of efficacy are encouraging in this R/R DLBCL subset. CC-122 studies are ongoing both as a single agent and in combination with other anti-lymphoma agents.   https://ash.confex.com/ash/2017/webprogram/Paper102096.html January 19, 2017 J Clin Oncol 35, 2017 (suppl 4S; abstract 379) Presented at the ASCO 2017 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, January 19-21, 2017, San Francisco, CA Abstract No. 379 Robin Kate Kelley, Kent C.

Gandhi, Kristen Hege, Michael Pourdehnad, Armando Santoro A phase IB, multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC122 administered orally to patients with advanced HCC. Interim Results:  As of Jan. 13, 2016, 25 advanced HCC subjects were enrolled. The median age was 59.6 years, median Child-Pugh score was 5 (range 5-8) and all were ECOG 0-1. Viral status was HBV 28%, HCV 28%, HBV/HCV 12% and non-viral 32%. 52% had alpha-fetoprotein > or = 200. CC122 was well tolerated. Two subjects discontinued due to AEs. Dose reductions occurred in 32% (n = 8). The most common ( > or = 5%) grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia, ALT elevation (each n = 4, 16%), AST elevation (n = 3, 12%), asthenia, ascites, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, pneumonia, and rash (each n = 2, 8%). Drugrelated serious AEs included vomiting and rash. 19 subjects were evaluable for efficacy. ORR was 10.5% (n = 2 PR, 1 confirmed) and Disease Control Rate (CR+PR+SD > 7 weeks) was 36.8%. The duration of response was 108 and 125 days in the 2 PRs. The median PFS was 57 days (MinMax: 28334, 95% CI: 45-135). CC122 treatment resulted in a median increase from baseline in peripheral blood activated and memory cytotoxic T cells by 64% (range: 17-213%, n = 6) and 78% (range: 30-111%, n = 6 (p < 0.05), respectively, and activated helper T cells by 106% (range: 62-218%, n = 7 (p < 0.05). CC122-activated T cells from the blood increased IFNg (2.73 fold; range: 0.45-26.1, n = 13) and IL2 (9.5 fold; range: 0.85-24.3, n = 11) production when compared to baseline (both P < 0.05) upon ex-vivo stimulation. Conclusions:  CC122 3 mg QD appears to be well tolerated and activates cytotoxic T cells in HCC patients. Combination studies with sorafenib or nivolumab are recommended and underway. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/177155-195 November 17, 2016 Neuro Oncol (2016) 18 (suppl 6): vi24.

A PHASE 1A/1B, MULTI-CENTER, OPEN-LABEL DOSE FINDING STUDY TO ASSESS THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY AND EFFICACY OF THE PLEIOTROPIC PATHWAY MODIFIER CC-122 ADMINISTERED ORALLY TO PATIENTS WITH GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME (GBM) AND OTHER BRAIN TUMORS Interim Results: As of Jan. 13, 2016, 47 patients with relapsed/refractory GBM and other brain tumors were enrolled: GBM (n=39), grade IV oligodendroglioma (n=1), grade III anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (1) grade II-III astrocytomas (n=4) and PCNSL (n=2). CC-122 was well tolerated at 3?mg QD (n=28), therefore, further dose escalation was explored in additional patients (n=19) at 4mg, 5mg or 6mg given either QD or on a 5/7days schedule. There were no DLTs, however, dose reduction (n=1) and interruptions (n=8) due to AEs were observed. The most common (> or = 5%) grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (10.6%), asthenia (6.4%) and general deterioration (6.4%). Drug-related serious AEs included febrile neutropenia, tumor hemorrhage, increase intracranial pressure, pulmonary embolism, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). AEs led to discontinuation in 10.6% of patients. 32 patients were evaluable for efficacy as of the cutoff date. The median PFS for patients was 58 days (Min-Max: 17-295, 95% CI: 50-111), while 21% of patients were progression-free at 6 months. CC-122 treatment resulted in a median increase from baseline of 86%, 133% and 165% in activated and memory cytotoxic T cells and activated helper T cells (all P<0.05), respectively, at Cycle 1 Day 15 in peripheral blood. CC-122 also activated T cells ex vivo as measured by increased levels of IFNg (131%) and IL-2 (685%) compared to baseline (both P<0.05). Preliminary CC-122 PK data suggest dose proportional increase in exposure in GBM patients. Conclusion: CC-122 is well tolerated. PK/PD analyses with correlation to clinical response are ongoing. http://neuro-oncology.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/suppl_6/vi24.1.abstract?sid=d72b8491-cc50-4b4c-a0cd-e0a60685394c#aff-13 http://neuro-oncology.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/suppl_6/vi24.1.full.pdf+html  December 6, 2014  Blood, Volume 124, Issue 21; December 6, 2014  Presented at American Society of Hematology 2014, December 6-9, 2014, San Francisco, CA, USA Abstract No: 3500 Vincent Ribrag, MD, Silvia Damien, MD, Mecide Gharibo, MD, Mercede Gironella, MD, Armando Santoro, MD, Drew W Rasco, MD, William Edenfield, MD, Xin Wei, PhD, Angela James, PhD, Patrick Hagner, PhD, Anita K.

The NHL cohort included 21 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 1 patient with mantle cell lymphoma, and twenty-four patients were enrolled in the MM cohort. Results in solid tumor cohorts will be reported separately. All patients were ECOG performance status 0-2, the median number of prior systemic therapies was 4 (NHL) and 6 (MM). The most common (> 20%) adverse events (AEs) (grades 1-4) included neutropenia (69.6%), anemia (52%), asthenia (50%), pyrexia (35%), diarrhea (30%), cough (30%), thrombocytopenia (28%), and constipation (22%). Grade 3/4 AEs occurring in more than one patient were neutropenia (52%), anemia (26%), febrile neutropenia (13%), and thrombocytopenia (7%). CC-122 dose reduction was required in 36.4% of patients with NHL and 63% of patients with MM, the majority of which was due to neutropenia and occurred during cycle 1 or 2. CC-122 systemic exposure in NHL and MM patients was generally comparable after administration of single and multiple doses. Peak concentrations were observed between 30 minutes and 2 hours (median Tmax concentration = 1.5 h). Four treated patients with DLBCL had objective responses; one patient with complete response (CR) and 3 with partial responses (PR). Responses were observed in patients with germinal center B cell (GCB), non-GCB and Myc/Bcl2 over-expressing DLBCL. Four treated patients with MM had PR, and two of these responders were progression free beyond 10 cycles. A single dose of  CC-122 3mg resulted in decreased Aiolos protein expression at 1.5 and 5 hours compared with baseline in peripheral B cells (median 38% and 53%) and T cells (median 31% and 54%) in the combined NHL (n = 16) and MM (n = 19) cohorts. Decrease in expression of Aiolos protein from baseline was also observed in lymph node biopsies of patients with DLBCL. Furthermore, CC-122 treatment decreased CD19+ B cells (median = 57% of baseline), expanded CD4-/CD8+/CD45RA-/CD45RO+ cytotoxic  memory T cells (median = 320% of baseline), and expanded CD4+/CD8-/CD45RA-/CD45RO+  helper memory T cells (median = 154% of baseline) in peripheral blood samples from patients with MM (n = 9) and NHL (n = 3-12) subjects. Additionally, ex vivo activation of T cells after a single dose of CC-122 compared with baseline, as measured by IL-2 production, increased by a median of 776% (NHL n = 3 and MM n = 7). Conclusions:   CC-122 shows promising initial clinical and pharmacodynamic activity in heavily pretreated relapse/refractory NHL and MM patients. Biomarker analysis indicates that the 3 mg QD dose of CC-122 results in rapid CRBN target engagement and Aiolos degradation in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with NHL and MM patients and in NHL tumor tissue. Exploration of an intermittent dosing to mitigate neutropenia-related dose reductions and interruptions is ongoing and clinical studies exploring drug combinations with CC-122 are underway.  https://ash.confex.com/ash/2014/webprogram/Paper68667.html http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/124/21/3500 October 21, 2013  Blood, Volume 122, Issue 21; October 21, 2013  December 7, 2013 Presented at American Society of Hematology 2013, December 7-10, 2013, New Orleans, LA, USA Abstract No: 2905  Drew W Rasco, MD1, Anita K Gandhi, PhD2, Angela James, PhD2, Shaoyi Li, PhD3, Edward O'Mara, MD2, Rajesh Chopra, M.D., Ph.D.2, Jorge F. DiMartino, MD, PhD4 and Kent Shih, MD5  A First In Human Dose Escalation Study Of CC-122, A First-In-Class Pleiotropic Pathway Modulator™ (PPM) Compound In Subjects With Relapsed Or Refractory Solid Tumors, Multiple Myeloma and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Interim Results: 34 subjects with solid or hematologic malignancies were treated in Part A, including NHL (5), MM (2), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (2), primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy (6), and others (19).  Twenty-eight (28) of these patients were evaluable for efficacy.  The most common (> or = 10%) treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs, all grades) were fatigue, neutropenia, asthenia, constipation, nausea, dyspnea, vomiting, anemia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, pruritis, pyrexia, alopecia, cough, headache, edema peripheral, tumor pain and urinary tract infection.  In addition, drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) included fever and fatigue in one subject (n=1, 3%), angioedema (n=1, 3%), and pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (n=1, 3%).  An NTD of 3.5 mg was determined with 2 DLTs in 6 subjects; one with Grade 3 fever and fatigue and one with Grade 3 generalized muscle weakness. The MTD was defined as 3 mg, with no DLTs. AEs were an uncommon cause of discontinuation (n = 2, 6%). Preliminary PK results support CC-122 being rapidly absorbed, with peak CC-122 plasma levels achieved between 0.5 and 3 hours after single (Day 1) and multiple oral doses of CC-122. Across the dose range evaluated, both Cmax and AUC appear to increase in an apparent dose-proportional manner. CC-122 mean exposure ranged from approximately 200 ng/mL to 1100 ng/mL across the dose range evaluated. The mean terminal half-life of CC-122 is generally between 10 and 15 hours. Moderate (30% - 40%) accumulation of CC-122 is observed after multiple-dose administration.  Dose and exposure-dependent decreases in peripheral B cell counts and enhanced T cell activation, as measured by ex vivo IL-2 production, were observed. Among 5 subjects with NHL, there was one partial and one complete response in 2 subjects with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and one partial response in a patient diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Conclusions:   CC-122 is a first-in-class PPM compound and a modulator of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.   CC-122 was dosed to a NTD of 3.5 mg, administered once-daily continuously. An MTD of 3 mg, administered once-daily continuously, was established. The main drug-related AEs were fatigue and neutropenia. AEs were an uncommon cause of discontinuation; therefore, the general safety findings support continued development. Increases in PK parameters were noted to be approximately dose-proportional and predictable through the range of doses evaluated.  Exposure-dependent pharmacodynamic effects involving immunomodulation were observed.  Further tumor cohorts will be explored at the 3 mg once-daily dose. Given the encouraging signals of clinical and biomarker activity observed, CC-122 shows promising activity in hematological malignancies.

Hagner, PhD, Celia Fontanillo, PhD, Amira Djebbari, DSc, Joel S. Parker, PhD, Clifton P. Drew, PhD, Fadi Towfic, PhD, Michael Pourdehnad, MD, Anita K. Gandhi, PhD and Matthew Trotter, PhD; Discovery of an Immune-Driven Gene Expression Signature That Predicts for Clinical Benefit to CC-122 in Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (R/R DLBCL). Results:  Based on the Lenz 2008 dataset, biological interpretation of the first phenotype identified pathways involved in the immune system and inflammatory response (phenotype 1), and the second phenotype was enriched for DNA replication/repair and cell cycle and RNA processing, indicating a proliferative signal and potentially higher B-cell content (phenotype 2). Phenotype 1 pts were also enriched in the 2 stromal signatures reported by Lenz et al, reflecting tumor infiltration by cells of the monocytic lineage and endothelial cells. Application of multiple immune deconvolution methods to the Lenz 2008 dataset identified an enrichment of T cells and macrophages in phenotype 1 and high B-cell content in phenotype 2. These observations yielded the hypothesis that differential contribution of these molecular phenotypes may predict pts who receive greatest benefit from CC-122. The gene expression classifier developed to separate pts in the Lenz dataset according to dominant phenotype was applied to gene expression data from Celgene trial CC-122-ST-001 to predict pts as phenotypic subgroup 1 (classifier-positive pts) or phenotypic subgroup 2 (classifier-negative pts). Initial observations in H&E staining confirmed significant differences (P<.01) in tumor cellularity (B-cell content) for classifier-positive (75%) vs classifier-negative (92%) pts (median 90 [SD 29.3; MAD 13.3] vs 98 [SD 13.7; MAD 1.5]), which reinforces the original interpretation of phenotypes discovered in the Lenz dataset. Application of the gene expression classifier to pre-treatment nCounter profiles from third-line or greater R/R DLBCL NOS pts in Celgene trial CC-122-ST-001 revealed an ORR of 34.8% and mPFS of 186 days for classifier-positive pts vs an ORR of 21.7% and mPFS of 49 days for classifier-negative pts (mPFS HR = 0.43; P=.02). No significant differences in overall survival were observed in first-line DLBCL pts treated with immunochemotherapy R-CHOP, suggesting that the classifier is not prognostic. Conclusions:  A novel gene expression classifier has been developed that predicts response and prolonged PFS to CC-122 in R/R DLBCL NOS but has no prognostic value. This classifier will be explored in future trials as an enrichment strategy for pts most likely to benefit clinically from CC-122. https://ash.confex.com/ash/2017/webprogram/Paper102098.html   Celgene pipeline as of August 2017 MULTIPLE MYELOMA (MM) CC-122 Area of Research:  Phase 1 http://media.celgene.com/content/uploads/product-pipeline.pdf July 27, 2017 Celgene Reports Second Quarter 2017 Operating and Financial Results ...

Gandhi, PhD  CC-122 Has Potent Anti-Lymphoma Activity through Destruction of the Aiolos and Ikaros Transcription Factors and Induction of Interferon Response Pathways   Results:  CC-122 inhibited proliferation (IC50=0.01-1.5µm) and induced apoptosis (6.5-12 fold) in 4 ABC and 3 GCB DLBCL cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. CC-122 induced rapid degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in a CRBN-dependent manner; an effect blocked by MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase complexes. In vivo anti-tumor activity of CC-122 was demonstrated in 2 xenograft models of human DLBCL, and was associated with significant reduction in Aiolos and Ikaros expression (94% and 69%, respectively, p<0.001) in tumor tissue within 6 hrs of administration. To identify proteins and signaling pathways affected by CC-122, tandem-mass tag proteomics was performed on DLBCL cells treated with vehicle or CC-122. While Aiolos and Ikaros levels decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner, Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) including IRF7, DDX58, and IFIT3 were notably increased (3, 5 and 12.5 fold, respectively). ISG induction with 24 hr CC-122 treatment was further confirmed by Western analysis. Surprisingly, the induction of ISGs occurred in the absence of increased interferon alpha, beta, or gamma levels, which was confirmed by qPCR and ELISA. Furthermore, shRNA targeting Aiolos led to inhibition of Aiolos protein expression (2-3 fold) and an increase in the mRNA and protein levels of IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 (10, 14 and 22 fold in mRNA expression, respectively). These data indicate that the increase in ISGs is a direct consequence of Aiolos degradation by CC-122 and bypasses the need for interferon production. Exploration of additional downstream functional gene candidates of CC-122 and shAiolos activity revealed a decrease in protein levels of Myc (up to 3 fold decrease with shAiolos), a key driver of DLBCL proliferation and survival associated with poor survival. Importantly, reduction of Aiolos expression and the consequent changes in the molecular pathways described led to inhibition of proliferation (2-4 fold versus control shRNA) and increased apoptosis (3-10 fold vs control shRNA), which paralleled CC-122 effects in DLBCL cells lines. Of note, CC-122 induction of ISGs was comparable in both ABC and GCB lines, whereas Len did not induce ISGs in GCB lines. The relationship between Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression and DLBCL cell of origin (COO) was further explored in primary DLBCL tissues. A tissue microarray containing 90 DLBCL patient cases immunohistochemically stained for Aiolos, Ikaros and COO markers (Hans) demonstrated Aiolos and Ikaros expression across GCB and non-GCB subtypes, suggesting that CC-122 may have broad-spectrum activity independent of COO.  In fact, Aiolos and Ikaros were degraded in lymph node biopsies from both GCB and non-GCB DLBCL patients administered CC-122. The predictive value of Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels for clinical response will be assessed in the Phase I study. Conclusion:  Aiolos degradation-dependent upregulation of ISGs represents a novel mechanism for the activity of CC-122. This mechanism bypasses the interferon-signaling pathway and occurs across cell of origin subtypes, suggesting this is a common mechanism accounting for the broad-spectrum activity of CC-122. Understanding of this mechanism has potential to greatly enhance the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL by guiding patient selection strategies and rational combination therapies.  https://ash.confex.com/ash/2014/webprogram/Paper75671.html http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/124/21/3035 December 04, 2013  Excerpted from: Sarah Cannon Research Institute has 37 abstracts accepted for poster presentation at the 2013 ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition ...Abstract # 2905 Abstract Title: A First In Human Dose Escalation Study Of CC-122, A First-In-Class Pleiotropic Pathway Modulator (PPM) Compound In Subjects With Relapsed Or Refractory Solid Tumors, Multiple Myeloma and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Author List: DW Rasco, AK Gandhi, A James, S Li, E O’Mara, R Chopra, JF DiMartino, K Shih Session: December 8, 2013 6:30-8:30pm 802.
