Note: induction with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplant and with or without maintenance therapy is considered a single regimen.\r\nMust have undergone at least 2 consecutive cycles of treatment for each regimen, unless PD was the best response to the regimen.\r\nMust have received a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody.\r\nMust be refractory to the last treatment regimen.\r\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.\r\nSubjects must have measurable disease, including at least one of the criteria below:\r\nSerum M-protein greater or equal to 1.0 g/dL\r\nUrine M-protein greater or equal to 200 mg/24 h\r\nSerum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level greater or equal to 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal\r\n- Bone marrow plasma cells > 30% of total bone marrow cells\r\nRecovery to Grade 1 or baseline of any non-hematologic toxicities due to prior treatments, excluding alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy.\r\nSubject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.\r\nSubject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements within this protocol as well as agrees to continued follow-up for up to 15 years as mandated by the regulatory guidelines for gene therapy trials.\r\nFemales of childbearing potential (FCBP (see note 1 below)) must:\r\n- Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the Investigator, one negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ß-hCG] pregnancy test result at screening, prior to LD chemotherapy. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact.\r\n- Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective measures of contraception without interruption, from screening through 1 year following last bb2121 infusion. Contraception methods must include 1 highly effective and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception from screening until at least 12 months following bb2121 infusion and until CAR T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests, whichever occurs last.\r\n- Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 1-year post-bb2121 infusion and until CAR T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests, whichever occurs last.\r\n\r\nNote 1: A female of childbearing potential is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).\r\n\r\nMale subjects must:\r\n- Practice true abstinence* or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. Subjects will be followed from screening until at least 1 year following last bb2121 infusion and until CAR T cells are no longer present by qPCR on two consecutive tests, whichever occurs last.\r\n\r\n* True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.",

Quality of Life C30 questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) [ Time Frame: up to 2 year after JWCAR infusion ]\r\nEORTC-QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single item measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale\r\n15. European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions health state classifier to 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) [ Time Frame: up to 2 year after JWCAR infusion ]\r\nThe EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems)\r\n16.

Changes of T cell counts, subgroups and serum cytokines [ Time Frame: up to 2 year after JWCAR infusion ]\r\n20. CD19 expression in tumor biopsy samples [ Time Frame: up to 2 year after JWCAR infusion ]\r\n21. Changes of inflammation biomarkers-CRP [ Time Frame: up to 1 year after JWCAR infusion ]\r\n22. Changes of inflammation biomarkers-serum ferritin [ Time Frame: up to 1 year after JWCAR infusion ]",
